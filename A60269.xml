            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Perhaps thou mayſt without much ſtreining gueſs whom I mean by <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drophilus</hi> perſonating the old Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy:
<pb facs="tcp:41852:5"/>if thou through any Analogy to the Peripatetick Philoſophy, he in his Book vindicates, or through any likeneſs to his moroſe Sentiments and dogmatical Placets, or by any other ſimilar Motives, ſhalt be drawn to conclude him to be the Perſon, I ſhall not gainſay; then may'ſt thou fix thy eye upon him, (no leſs like than a well drawn Coppy, to the Original) as the grand Champion of that Old Cauſe or if thou approve not thereof, may by that name imagine any other perſon indifferently, ſpeaking for, and arguing on the behalf of that lean and therefore hectically inclin'd, and well nigh expiring Philoſophy, which will certainly dye of a Conſumption, in Tract of time (as the other comes on, and grows vigorous,) wearing inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly away.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:41852:6"/>
            <p>In this Treatiſe, as in a Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip, mayſt view ſuch a draught (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in Epitome) of the Principles of natural Philoſophy, as if drawn to the Life, may generally and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inely (without any force) repreſent and ſolve (we think) natures <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> in the apparances of moſt Bodies we meet with: In it may find ſuch a ſet of the Elements of natural Bodies, as (if wound up to the height) may conſpire the procuring a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophick harmony: Not to ſay here, how teeming a womb our Principles have, nor how they do quadrate (and that perhaps more univerſally) with Nature in her abſtruce cauſes, nor how conſiſtent with themſelves, nor laſtly how adapted to the regular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Nature, and accommodated to the rendring intelligible Natures
<pb facs="tcp:41852:6"/>model in the Fabrick, <hi>Metaſtaſis,</hi> and taking in pieces of Bodies, viz. in making Philoſophick apparances more conſpicuous to our underſtanding, but refer all our ſpeculations to ſtand at the Bar of thy more mature (not I hope ſevere) judgment.</p>
            <p>We have in this enſuing diſcourſe, but ſleightly touch'd upon our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, eſpecially that ſeaven-fold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Fire, whoſe Principles are under one or other of the ſeven modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, twiſted or interwoven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt moſt Bodies (eſpecially Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, Vegetables, and many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals) we converſe with: yet may <hi>ex ungue leonem,</hi> meaſure the whole by the ſcantling: the further and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſcourſe thereof, we refer to its proper place <hi>(viz.)</hi> to our <hi>Tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Phyſiologic.</hi> to which this is
<pb facs="tcp:41852:7"/>chiefly introductory: As to our <hi>Halo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia Chymica</hi> being our diſcourſe of Salts, and our <hi>Lithologia Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica</hi> concerning petrification, to both which we ſometimes refer the Reader: our labours therein are at preſent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Embrio,</hi> yet pretty forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Birth, if at their full time ſhall be thought worthy to be borne, may ere long ſee light.</p>
            <p>Seeing the field of Nature is very large, and many may be taking mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereof by their ſeveral ways of <hi>Phyſico-metrical</hi> commenſuration, and that every one has his liberty to ſurvey her with the beſt inſtruments <hi>Mechaniſm</hi> will afford; and yet the Artiſts and all the Tools they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure or invent, the former too ſhort ſighted, and the latter too few, to reach her profundity, to ſind out the <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drature</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:41852:7"/>of her Circle, or to take the exact dimention of her Solids.</p>
            <p>So that there is work enough for as many <hi>Geomitricians</hi> (I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſaid <hi>Pioneers</hi>) to Nature, as are adapted by long obſervation, and ſtudy for that work: And in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion all the late <hi>Phyſico-Metrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (if I may ſo call them) have in one ſort or other done well; Thus <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chenius, Vander Bect, Beckerus,</hi> &amp;c. have every one in their ſeveral capacities perform'd ſome ſervice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on improvement of Philoſophy; not that I could, or would juſtify each of theſe in their ſeveral Hypotheſes, but I think they have done this great piece of ſervice, in that they have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed us with many mechanical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, which although each in their way makes uſe of for building
<pb facs="tcp:41852:8"/>their particular Hypotheſis, yet we may well admit them as materials <hi>(viz.)</hi> Wood, Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in order to a further and more rational Fabrick: but above all theſe, the noble and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Boyle</hi> has laid in ſo many materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, by his curious and manifold me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical experiments and obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as has thereby furniſhed the Checker of learning with a vaſt ſtock.</p>
            <p>Hence its reaſonable (I ſay) every one ſhould have liberty not only in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in materials, but alſo of venturing (if he have skill in building) to put them together, what freedom I have taken herein, is no more than what is in common to any other: And in ſhort, whether I have us'd any skill in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting together thoſe notions I had grounded upon mechanical experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and what uniformity there is in
<pb facs="tcp:41852:8"/>the Fabrick I have ventur'd on in this enſuing, and in other tracts already publiſhed, or yet to publiſh, (being room enough in the vaſt ſhop of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for as many as pleaſe to ſet up for themſelves) is refer'd (gentle Reader) to thee to determine.</p>
            <p>And wherein I fall ſhort in this tract, (as being only an abſtract of the Principles of Philoſophy) I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make up in my <hi>Zymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia Phyſica,</hi> or Philoſophical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Fermentation, (a noble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and worthy the beſt of Pens,) to which occaſionally I ſometimes refer: alſo in my aforeſaid pieces.

                  <p>True, <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> the circuit of nature is of a large extent, many (not to ſay infinite) are the Meanders of that intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Maze of things we converſe with; one Century is not enough, nor a great many Philoſophers ſufficient to pry narrowly and well to ſearch into, ſo as throughly to find out the vaſt depth of all the ſecrets of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or to inveſtigate every Phoenomenon of the Mundan Suſteme, or rightly to know every <hi>Encheireſis,</hi> and the Motion of every Wheel of the vaſt Machin of the World.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41852:18"/>or ſpermatic Principles in the Fabric of Vegetable and Animal Bodys, and by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what analogous thereto, even in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of all other mixts: and that thoſe various changes amongſt bodys one into another, aſcribable to generation and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, are no other than the different Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtaſis of the conſtituent Particles of bodys, or the various interweavings and complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their inteſtine Principles; which whether ſhifting places in the ſame concretes give the different Phaenomena incident to the ſame body, while its conſtituent parts and genuine ferments keep their natural te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, method, and order, proper thereto, or elſe ſeparating a portion of the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecate parts, which contain an effloreſcence of the whole, become by further and more gradual elaboration, ſpermatic Principles (being the whole reduc'd to an Epitome) congenial to what at firſt was ſet on work by the Primitive <hi>Fiat,</hi> for the upholding the creation by propagation, or ſimilar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions.</p>
                  <p>In all which the main affection of matter is local-motion, where the parts in ſuch ſize, ſhape and figure, by motion, guided by ſeminal Principles, with their congenit and peculiar colliſions make up the texture, ſuppoſe of one body: The ſame parts being

                  <p>Only with this difference, that in bodys that are propagated by ſeminals or ſeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, the motion is guided by the ſeminal Principles and fermental Colliſions connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thereto.

                  <p>But as to a true ſolution of the inſtance which you propound <hi>(Hydroph.) viz.</hi> how
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41852:20"/>this change of bodies happens whereby they are (<hi>Proteus</hi>-like) transform'd out of one ſhape into another, may, I judg, be thus explicated <hi>(viz.)</hi> when the natural fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the juyces of the body of the Ox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which while uniform and in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive and edifying motion, upheld by its natural balſam the fleſh and other parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,) had ceaſed by the death of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, then the ſame ferments by a retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade motion unravel their formerly wound-up clew, and for want of ſome imbalming ſaline particles, which chiefly conſiſted in the progreſſive motion of the ferments, a putrid fermentation begins, which by an analyſis of the body takes it in pieces, and in its reduction <hi>ad minima,</hi> ſome acid and ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous parts combine with ſome ſeminal <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia,</hi> and by a tranſpoſition of parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come animated into ſuch or ſuch a form, where, by the different Metaſtaſis of the ſulphureous and ſome fluid ſaline particles, directed in their loco-motion by ſome ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal emanations (lurking in the inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the body) they become together determin'd into ſuch a peculiar ſhape of an other texture and form from what it was before.</p>
                  <p>That the ſhape, figure, and form of theſe new products are determin'd either by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41852:20"/>
                     <hi>effluvia,</hi> or by new ferments which conſpiring with the fluid, ſaline and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous parts in the analytical ſolution of the compage of the former body, make them combine into ſuch a ſhape different from what it was before, might, I ſay, be demonſtrated by many inſtances: the firſt is confirmed by the body of a Duck buried, from which (as <hi>Kircher</hi> obſerves) Toads may be ingendered, and that from ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal parts of a Toad which lurk in the humours or fleſh of a Duck nouriſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, which by putrefaction are ſet a work and draw into conſent ſome fluid ſaline and ſulphureous parts reſolv'd by the putredinous ferment and joyntly are determined into the form of a Toad.</p>
                  <p>Thus Worms are ingendred by a putred ferment in the blood and other conſtituent humours and fleſh of animals, as alſo of the humane body: in ſo much as <hi>Shenkins</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that Worms have been found even in the very heart: And <hi>Pareus</hi> tells us, they have been ſeen in the Liver, Lungs, Reins, and Bladder; yea the maſs of blood under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going any putrid reſolution proves vermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſaith to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Regiones membrorum ſuos vermes noverunt, ita enim per anatomiam in cerebro repertus eſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miculus qui piam &amp; duram matrem pertuderat,

                  <p>Laſtly, Other Mutations there are <hi>(Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droph.)</hi> of Bodys out of one ſhape into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which owe their original to either, or both of the aforeſaid cauſes <hi>(viz.)</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Effluvia's, or new Ferments: of which ſort are the production of Scorpions in the Brain of a Man, by frequent ſmelling at the Herb <hi>Baſil,</hi> or from the fracedinous ferment of the ſame Herb betwixt two Stones, the ſame Animal may be produc'd, as both <hi>Helmont</hi> and <hi>Kircher</hi> obſerve: it's very probable this Plant may take its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41852:22"/>from ſome putredinous reſolution of a Scorpion, as the <hi>Satyrions</hi> of divers ſorts do from the Sperm of ſeveral Animals, which fermenting in the <hi>leffas terrae,</hi> produce thoſe Plants with thoſe Signatures of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitals.</p>
                  <p>For (I muſt tell you <hi>Hydroph.</hi>) as there is ſcarce any Plant in whoſe putrid <hi>Analyſis</hi> it gives not an Animal of one ſort or other; ſo there are many Animals out of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridneſs of whoſe ſpermatic parts fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting with the nutritive Juyce of the Earth, Plants may be produc'd, of which ſort are <hi>Baſil,</hi> all the kinds of <hi>Orchis, Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions, Muſhrooms, Androſemum, &amp;c.</hi> yea, and from the like cauſes may many poiſonous Plants take their original: For as the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious <hi>Kircher</hi> obſerves, many or moſt of theſe Plants are found to grow in <hi>morticinis cadaverum, viz.</hi> where dead Carcaſes have been corrupted upon the Ground, or been buried in the Earth, in which places <hi>Hemlock, Wolfsbane, Monkshead, Henbane, Aſſafaetida, wild Camomel, &amp;c.</hi> are moſt frequently found: where from the ſpermatic parts of putrid cadaverous Bodys, fermenting with the ſucculent parts of the Earth, or other Excrements, new ſhapes are aſſumed, either of other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, or Plants, according to the direction of ſeminal Effluvia, or ſpecifical Ferments.</p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:41852:22"/>
                  <p>So that the <hi>Metaſtaſis</hi> of thoſe Bodys out of one ſhape into another, whereby they are very differently repreſented to our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Organs (as that which was lately an Animal, may become a Plant, and that which was a Plant, may preſently be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into an Animal) may very well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed (as I ſaid) partly from the <hi>loco</hi>-motion, or tranſpoſition of ſeminal Principles, and partly from the awakening of new Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> how I have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven mine with your inſtances, and that the better to illuſtrate the manner of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Bodys out of one form into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby we may be able to ſolve the urgent <hi>Phaenomena</hi> incident to Bodys in their <hi>Metaſtaſis,</hi> or Transfiguration (if I may ſo call it) by the various extenſion of the parts of matter differently guided by ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Principles, and ſpecifiic Ferments, without having recourſe at all to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Materia Prima,</hi> his <hi>Quaternary of Elements, ſubſtantial Forms,</hi> or other general affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aſcribable to natural Bodys according to the Theory of the Vulgar Peripatetick Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</p>

                  <speaker>Pyroph.</speaker>
                  <p>I have already (though in ſhort) given you hints by ſeveral inſtances, how I apprehend the Mutation of Bodys out of one ſhape into another do happen. Now <hi>(Hydro.)</hi> I ſhall give you an abbreviate Account of my thoughts, how theſe (thus liable to muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) are compos'd.</p>
                  <p>And that firſt by ſhewing you, that the Matter, Bodys (I mean ſuch as are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by one ſpecifical ſhape or other) are made up of, is the ſame (as to the material and conſtitutive part of Concretes) with that which is in common to them, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in their <hi>Metaſtaſis</hi> out of one form into another: and therein to ſhew, how it lies under a three-fold conſideration, of ſo many general Affections: Next to ſhew what are thoſe hidden Agents and mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Principles ſhut up in the ſeminaries of all ſuch ſort of Bodys, by which thoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Affections, and eſſential qualifications of Matter, are exerted, and manuducted, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41852:24"/>not only to the Fabric, but pulling down, conſtruction, but reduction of all ſuch Bodys. Laſtly: Inſtances to ſhew how all this is done by illuſtrating upon ſeveral remarkable <hi>Phaenomena</hi> amongſt Vegetables and Animals.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt, How Matter as Matter is the common ſubject the <hi>materia ſubſtrata</hi> of all natural Bodys, which we elſe where ſhew to be Water, or ſuch a texture of the parts of Matter, as ſooner or later fall into that fluid body, we call Water, the parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of however rarifyed, or ſubtilized, as really water, I mean when condens'd, or collected, and ſeminal Maſques taken off, as every ſpark of Fire, is Fire, concerning which we take occaſion to inlarge in our <hi>Tentamen Phyſiolog.</hi> to which we refer you.</p>
                  <p>As to the general and eſſential affections of matter, in order to the ſtructure of Bodys, the firſt is Motion, and that no other than <hi>loco</hi>-motion, or an inteſtine colliſion of the conſtituent parts: For without ſuch motion neither would the parts of matter be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to convene in any form for the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Bodys, nor would the texture of thoſe Bodys already ſuppos'd to be in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> ever be changed out of one into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which yet muſt neceſſarily be granted as long as things appear upon the wheel of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41852:24"/>on the ſtage of the World: all things, I ſay, would be at reſt, and in a calm ſtilneſs, all the Springs, Wheels, Cords, and Pullies (to ſpeak like a <hi>Corpuſcularian</hi>) of automatous Productions, would be let down, diſordered, broke, and out of joynt, if mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould ceaſe, which therefore makes it an affection both general and eſſential to matter.</p>
                  <p>The next eſſential qualification of matter is diviſibility: For if matter ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible into minute parts, there could be no difference of Bodys, all would have the ſame ſhape, and the varieties we ſee of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys in the nurſery of the World would not be: therefore matter muſt fall under our conſideration as diviſible into minute parts, yea, and of thoſe many may be ſo ſmall and indiſcernable as may eſcape any perception by our ſenſes, though never ſo acute or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed by the beſt of artificial contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>The third eſſential affection of matter is Extenſion: which is that whereby the concentred parts of one parcel of matter, may be ſo inlarged as to fill a greater ſpace, or to meaſure a larger Tract (by manifold) than it did before: For matter being ſet on work by motion, which in the fabric of bodys conſiſts in an inteſtine colliſion, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41852:25"/>being divided thereby into minute parts, which combining in ſuch or ſuch a texture make up ſuch a ſhape as is repreſented by one body or other: This again being ſub-divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or taken in pieces by ſome ſuch active principles of matter, which we call Fire, Ferments, Salts or Solvents is thereby made capable of extending a larger ſpace than it did before.</p>
                  <p>Thus matter (or water the original ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix of all concrete bodys) being moved, divided, and in a ſort extended one part upon another by the manuduction of Seeds or Ferments towards the production, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of an Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral Concrete, which being determin'd into ſome peculiar ſhape (not jumping by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental and blind concourſe of the muſtring Atoms into ſpontaneous textures of bodys, according to the wild <hi>Epicurean</hi> Doctrine but) by the ſeminal Principles (call'd by the <hi>Hermetic</hi> Philoſophers the innate Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic Spirit.) This, I ſay, being further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd either by Fire, Ferments, Salts, or Solvents, becomes capable of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended over a much larger ſpace than before: ſo that extenſion of matter has relation both in order to the fabric of bodys as bodys, as alſo in order to the <hi>Metaſtaſis</hi> thereof out of one ſhape into another.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:41852:25"/>
                  <p>Now, I ſay, as matter in order to the texture of bodys has the eſſential affections of Motion, Diviſibility and Extenſion; ſo we are to conceive of theſe parts divided under ſome ſhape, ſize, or figure, whereby they may the better convene in ſuch poſtures as may by the manuduction of Seeds and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments make up the generality of mixt bodys in the World: with what figure ſo ever they be in their minuteſt parts phyſically diviſible into, yet till they arrive at others by cloſe combinations they fall not under our cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance as principles of bodys, as we fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declare in our <hi>Tentamen Phyſiolog.</hi>

                  <speaker>Hydroph.</speaker>
                  <p>But pray <hi>(Pyroph.)</hi> what are thoſe Seminal Principles and Ferments (the next thing you propos'd to diſcourſe of) which you call hidden Agents and mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Inſtruments ſhut up in the ſeminaries of all ſuch bodys, to which you refer much of your Doctrine of Natural Bodys, chiefly in order to the Fabric of Vegetables and Animals, and by which you ſeem to differ from the Philoſophy of the <hi>Corpuſcularians?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pyroph.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> that I confeſs, for the better underſtanding the Baſis of Natures works, in the eſtabliſhing a well-grounded Hypotheſis, we are rightly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what is underſtood by ſeminal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Ferments.</p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:41852:26"/>
                  <p>By ſeminal Principles, therefore I mean the ſame with what I elſewhere (in my <hi>Tentamen Phyſiolog.</hi>) call <hi>ſemina foecunda,</hi> or Seeds, which I ſuppoſe (for none dare po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively aver) are Minute Portions of the two Principles <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> concentred and wound upon a very ſmall bottom, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted and wrapt up by the parent of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in ſmall raiments of matter, <hi>ubi prima cuduntur rerum ſtamina,</hi> which Principles in one are ſpecifically differenc'd from what they are an another, whence the great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in the textures of bodys of all Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables and Animals: which Principles are, I ſay, the organical Inſtruments and mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Agents included in all thoſe bodys vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly call'd Seeds: wrapt up, I ſaid, in ſmall raiments of matter, not but that theſe Principles themſelves are alſo material, and are at the long run reducible into Water, the material Principle of all Concretes, but with this difference, that they are pure ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile parts, (entangled in more groſs) adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for motion, or that colliſion we ſuppoſe indiſpenſibly neceſſary in the Fabric of all ſuch Bodys.</p>
                  <p>By Ferments here, we mean the fore-ſaid Principles (being ſeminal ſparks hidden in matter) which are (other requiſites duly concurring) actually put into motion, or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41852:26"/>ſet into a natural and genuine colliſion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Principles in the progreſſive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their colliſion, yea, and in the whole round of their operation, (becoming there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by actual Ferments) give according to their various ſtades, the different <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the ſame body: ſo that all the apperances are meaſur'd forth according to the progreſs or regreſs of the aforeſaid Principles. Thus Vegetation (as to Plants) is nothing elſe (as we elſe-where in our <hi>Zymolog. Phyſic.</hi> and <hi>Tentamen</hi> further ſay) but a ſlow pac'd mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or gentle colliſion of the aforeſaid Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, conſiſting in an inteſtin ſtrugling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>Thus for inſtance in the production of a Vegetable Seed-bearing Plant, as ſuppoſe of <hi>Roſemary, Marjoram, Time, &amp;c.</hi> where we have nothing but the minute Seed with the intrinſic Principles, which are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate plaſtic <hi>Faber</hi> ſeated in the Center there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and what it can determine matter into: Now when this Seed, being put into a due capacitated Matrix or Earth, begins, by the fructifying nitrous Salt in the Earth, or Air, or both, together with the concurrance of an aetherial matter, &amp;c. (requiſite to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all Vegitable Springs into motion) to open it ſelf, the Principles or hidden mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Agents (or that ſeminal embryona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41852:27"/>ſpark, lock'd up in the viſible Grain, or Seed) become an actual Ferment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Matter, which is always mov'd at the beck of thoſe implanted Principles, and is thereby ſub-divided into minute parts, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Pores, and Streiners thereof, with ſuch adaptation of Particles proportionable thereto, which becomes thereby extended, and is by the fore-ſaid actual Ferment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to that Seed, wrought into ſuch a tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of parts, or ſpecifical form ſingly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to that Plant: where the ſhape, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſapour, odour, and other ſpecifical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments are determin'd by the ſeminal Principles, ſet into a fermental motion, and are the reſults of Matter formally extended thereby: For that a Plant ſhould conſtantly (and more forcibly, during the time of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of its natural Ferment) breath forth ſo ſtrong an <hi>apporrhoea,</hi> or odour, as to be able to ſmite our ſenſes therewith, as if 20, yea 100 could (as ſometimes they may) ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Orb of its activity, might all be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thereof, is, I ſay, a demonſtrable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the extenſibility of Matter and ſubtile Emanation of ſubtiliz'd or volatiz'd Parts, even in the Fabric of that Plant, carried off by the quick actions of the aforeſaid Ferment; which is yet further diſcoverable, either by the reverſe motion of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41852:27"/>Principles of the Plant, whereby the ſame ferment in its Retrograde motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes putredinous, cauſing (in ſome Plants but eſpecially in Animals) a fetidneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo happens a <hi>Metaſtaſis</hi> into an Inſect (from cauſes aforeſaid) or by force of fire into a fume of 100 yea 1000 fold larger com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs than the body it ſelf was, which fume although extending ſo large a ſpace, is yet ſo groſs as to make it ſelf the object of our ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> how the ſame Principles, which lay dormant in the ſeed, (while in the Garner) where they are pois'd in <hi>equilibrio,</hi> and remain alone, ſo long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of fructifying or multiplying; how? I ſay, in order to the awakening theſe Principles and putting them into a fermental motion, there are ſome concurring requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites duly to be conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> that it ſhould be caſt into a peculiar Soil or Ground, as its proper Matrix, which is the Matrix of the Husk, as the Husk is of the true Seed, where the <hi>Leffas Terrae</hi> (or juice of the Earth) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imbued with ſo much nitrous Salt as is ſufficient, ſoftens the Husk and makes it ſwell, whoſe compage being loos'd, the Air with its other (neceſſarily concurring to the exciting the Principles in every vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Production) getting entrance, awakes or
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41852:28"/>puts the implanted <hi>Embrio</hi>-Principles into motion, thereby rendring them fermental; whence the noble Seed ſhut up in an obſcure point, ariſeth, whoſe mechanical Principles (neceſſary to the building all Bodies) are I ſay, call'd forth to act, break the Priſon-doors, and in their mutual wreſtlings, cauſe that grand <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of Nature, we call Vegetation, where Water by the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Seeds or ſeminal Principles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes determined into fibrous off-ſhoots, &amp; thoſe being hollow, carry along more of the ſucculent juyces, which as it flows in thoſe Pipes, upon its acceſs, more Fibers, Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſels, and others, (whether as Veins, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> analogous to Animals, we refer to the particular diſquiſitions of the worthy <hi>Malpighius,</hi> &amp; our Countryman Dr. <hi>Grew</hi>) are produced; while the formerly made Veſſels by acceſs of Air (or being long expos'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) become condenſed or hardned into ſtalks, wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo is wrought on, by the weavings of the foreſaid ſeminal Principles, till the whole Plant or Tree put on its intire form of Root, Stalk, Bole, Bark, Branch, Fruit, or Flower.</p>
                  <p>Beſides which weavings, coagulations, and condenſations of water into vegetable concretions from cauſes aforeſaid, its more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over if I miſtake not <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> as eaſie (and

                  <p>So that theſe Principles in their gentle col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſions are not only the cauſe of Vegetation in all manner of Plants and Trees, and the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apparences thereto belonging, both of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and corruption, weavings and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weavings of Bodies by the winding on and off, of the Principles; but alſo put into new

                  <p>BUt before you paſs from the diſcourſe of your Principles as concern'd in Vegetation, and having touch'd ſomewhat relating to the Propagation of Plants in your piece of Fermentation: pray <hi>(Pyroph.)</hi> how are they (I mean your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) concern'd in that manner of Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Trees, and perhaps ſome Plants by ingrafting and inoculation, and what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements may thereby be made?</p>

                  <p>Well reminded <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> For that we may nor buſie out ſelves with em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty and fruitleſs Speculations (the uſual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41852:30"/>of your old Philoſophy,) it will be neceſſary in order to the eſtabliſhing and confirming our Hypotheſis, to acquaint you in anſwer to your deſire, that the ingrafting or inoculation of a Cion or Bud into the bole of a Stock in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the propagation of Fruit-trees for the improvement of Nurſeries, ſeems to me, <hi>Hydroph.</hi> to be nothing elſe but an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial planting of thoſe trees, as if they were indeed put into a good proper ſoyl, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſeeds into ſutable beds of Earth; whereby the ſeminal Principles concentred in the Seed, or contracted into thoſe prolifique Buds, are put into their proper Matrix, which with other requiſites concurring, are ſet into their vegetative ſpring, or fermental motion: And that the adaptneſs of ſtocks anſwers the peculiarity of ſoyls, in as much as all ſorts of Cions are no more properly or with expected ſucceſs, to be grafted or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated in any ſort of Stock, than any ſort of ſoyl is naturally fitted and qualified for every kind of Seed, only with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that in the one (<hi>viz.</hi> the Earth) the juice prepar'd lies more crude, and ſcatter'd, yea, is more liable to caſualties, eſpecially to injuries by cold, while the other (in the ſap in ſtocks) is more digeſted (if I may ſo ſay) and better collected into Veſſels, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41852:30"/>ſtrainers, and laſtly, is not ſo expos'd to caſualties, nor ſo open to injuries by acceſs of cold: Now that the bole of one Tree is as a peculiar ſoyl to the proper ingrafted or inoculated prolifique Gem (for both graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inoculation are but the planting or inſertion of the ſame ſeminal Bud or Cion) is hence evident, becauſe if Earth be ſo much caſt up as to reach above the place of inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation (or graft too, if I miſtake not) after they have taken good hold and that it hath ſent forth Branches, the prolifique bud caſts forth fibrous Roots, juſt as if it (or the Seed) was originally put into ſo much well prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſoyl: ſo that the Root and Bole of a Tree do no other, (I mean as to ingrafting and inoculation) than prepare a juice fit for the nouriſhment, growth and increaſe of any other ſutable Graft or Gem inſerted therein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; which the aforeſaid Gem imbibes and tranſmutes by its own fermental Principles, into its own nature, admitting not of the leaſt tincture of the native diſpoſition or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal inclination from the aſſumed Sap, but daſhing all thoſe preconceiv'd ſeminal tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, make uſe of it to no other purpoſe (according to the intent of Nature in her great work of propagation, where ſhe is ſo ſo exact and curious as in nothing more) than thereby to ſtrike up the new vegetative
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41852:31"/>implanted ſpark, whoſe Principles being thereby ſet awork, become fermental, and ſo imploys that juice in the fabrick of its own peculiar Body, guided and ſhap'd by its own plaſtick <hi>faber,</hi> I mean its foreſaid ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and now (being exerted into motion) fermental Principles, carrying on the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by its inteſtine ſlow-pac'd colliſion (vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly called Vegetation.)</p>
                  <p>Thus for inſtance, we commonly inoculate a fruitful Bud or Cion of an <hi>Aprecock</hi> or <hi>Peach</hi> into a <hi>Plum</hi>-ſtock, whoſe thriving, budding, putting forth Branches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are no other than the evident indexes of the action of the ſeminal Principles of thoſe inoculated Gems, which being ſet into motion (by requiſites duely concurring) admit of the juice or Sap of the bole (they are inoculated into) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes fermental, daſhing the preconceiv'd ſeminal tincture of the Stock (whereby it was diſpos'd to the putting on the form of a <hi>Plum</hi>-tree) tranſmutes that juice into its own nature, and ſo from the inteſtine ſtruglings of the ſaid ſeminal Principles of the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced inoculated Bud, proceeds the vegetation and growth of the whole, clothing it ſelf with all thoſe natural Liveries peculiar to the texture of ſuch ſeminal prolifique Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                  <p>Now that this ſap of the Stock is as a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41852:31"/>prepared ſoyl, or a peculiar Earth for the Seed to be ſown in, and wherein it thrives as well (if not better) than in a natural ſoyl, is evident <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> becauſe if you throw up Earth (after it has begun to thrive and put forth Branches) above the place where it was inoculated, it takes Root by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth fibrous Shoots, which you may then tranſplant, (cutting off the former Root and Bole) and ſo it becomes an intire Tree of it ſelf: and from the ſame cauſes it is, that you may by ſplicing (as the Gardiners call it) propagate as many Trees as you pleaſe: alſo by layers (as they are called) you may propagate as many Trees almoſt as there are prolifique Buds if they couid all be conveniently laid, whereby every Bud (or as many as you pleaſe) gets a Root to it ſelf, by taking in that Sap from the Earth, which they do from Stocks they are otherwiſe planted into: In all which, the ſeminal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are ſet a work and become fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, hurling forth bodies or clothings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the form of the plaſtic <hi>faber</hi> ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Center: whence it appears, I ſay, that the Sap of the Stock is to a Cion or or prolifique Bud, as the Earth to a Seed, or as the Earth to a laid Cion.</p>
                  <p>Now the improvements, <hi>Hydroph.</hi> that hence may be drawn, are various, and that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41852:32"/>in order to the accelleration, melioration, and fructification of ſome Trees in other Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates or Countries than where they natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally grow; Thus we daily ſee the Imps of an <hi>Aprecock</hi> haſtned as to its fructifying, by being inſerted into <hi>Plum</hi>-ſtocks, <hi>Peaches,</hi> by being put into <hi>Aprecock, Flanders, Hart, Duke,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cherries,</hi> put into wild or black <hi>Cherry</hi>-Stocks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which thereby in two or three years become Fruit-bearing-Trees, which would not in many more, if ſet from a Stone or Seed, or propagated from a ſlip'd Cions: which are not thereby only haſtened as to their growth and maturity, but alſo are bettered thereby, both as to bulk of Fruit as alſo pleaſantneſs and gratefulneſs of taſte.</p>
                  <p>Thus probably the prolifique Imp or Bud of <hi>Quinces,</hi> skilfully put into early <hi>Apple</hi>-ſtocks, might haſten them as to maturity; later <hi>Grapes</hi> of a more delicate taſte, artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inoculated into more early, might do the ſame: yea very likely if acurate tryals were made of this nature, probably not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Melons</hi> (as to Plants) inſerted into <hi>Pompi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> might make them both more early and more large, eſpecially if the Seeds of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi> ſhould be brought up in hot-beds to be ready early in the Spring, while the other are alſo foſter'd in the ſame, till they were
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41852:32"/>fit for inſerting: But alſo many other rare obſervations might be made concerning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maturations and meliorations of Plants and Fruits, not yet taken notice of.</p>
                  <p>As to the third improvement, <hi>viz.</hi> the aſſiſtance of Nature by Art, in the fructifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſome Trees in other Climates or Countries than where they naturally grow; Thus probably if the prolific Bud of <hi>Oranges</hi> (train'd up from their ſeedlings in hot-beds, or other ſuitable ſoyl) were inſerted into ſome ſort of Trees that grow well with us, and ſeem ſomewhat to reſemble them, as for inſtance in ſome choice <hi>Apples</hi> (as <hi>Pippins</hi> or <hi>Pearmains</hi>) or in <hi>Quinces,</hi> thence we might very probably have <hi>Oranges</hi> to grow fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with us in <hi>England:</hi> for the reaſon, why ſuch tender Trees (more accuſtomed to hotter Climates) do not fructiſy with us, is cheifly through the defect of concurring cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, (which I above call by the name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites duely concurring) amongſt which are moſt conſiderable the want of a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent heat, or the preſence of our intenſe cold or froſt in the Winter time, which reaching the Roots of ſuch tender Trees, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents their Fruit-bearing by ſuſpending the fermental action of the Principles, if not totally kills them.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> according to our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41852:33"/>prov'd ſuppoſition, that Stocks anſwer Soils, and are really as ſuch to prolific Buds: therefore if inſtead of training up <hi>Orange</hi>-Trees from hot Nurſeries, we take their prolific Imps, which we can by hot Beds eaſily procure, and inſert them by Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Stocks or Branches of any, or the moſt likely of thoſe Trees aforeſaid, we thereby ſecure them from intenſe Froſts we uſually have in Winters, the chief defect amongſt requiſites concurring, and which hinders otherwiſe the Fruit-bearing of ſome Trees in other Climates than naturally they ſpring up in: which, I ſay, being remov'd by the aforeſaid artificial Expedient, gives great likelihood of having upon ſuch tryal, plenty of <hi>Oranges</hi> growing with us in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus alſo if the fruitful Buds of Figgs (which rarely in <hi>England</hi> come to maturity for want of heat, and chiefly by being late) were inoculated into ſome ſort of good Pears (for inſtance <hi>Bergamots,</hi> or ſome other early Pear) or Branches thereof, might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably procure their maturity: and thereby to ſit peaceably under the improvements of our Vines and our Figg-Trees.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the aforeſaid due requiſites ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily concurring, I chiefly mean Climates, and thence different Soils (although there
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41852:33"/>are alſo great variety of Soils under the ſame Climate) where, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of natural heats from the Sun, the Principles are put into a ſlower or quicker Motion, from whoſe more flat or ſharp and agil colliſions, ſome Bodys or Fruits are wrought with a courſer or finer ſpun tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or by longer weavings become more elaborate, and arrive at higher maturities, whence proceed Fruits of more delicate taſt, affecting the Palat more gratefully.</p>
                  <p>What improvements <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> might hence be made, nothing but matter of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment will ſatisfie, concerning the meliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, at leaſt inlarging of <hi>Collyflowers,</hi> by taking the ſuperannuated ſtem or bole of a choice ſort of <hi>Cabbage</hi> (which the year before has been prevented of bearing Fruit, by cutting it off while young) and early thereinto the next Spring to inſert a <hi>Collyflower</hi> (brought up in a hot or other prepared Bed, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd over Winter from its ſeed put down in <hi>Autumn.</hi>) And ſo many more choice Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations might be made, the truth of which only matter of tryal will evince and ſatisfie the curious ſearcher.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, What improvements might hence alſo be made <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> is only here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to further tryal, in order to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Roſes (and perhaps other Flowers)
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41852:34"/>all the Winter long, by inoculating their prolific Buds at a due ſeaſon into ſome <hi>Sempervives,</hi> or <hi>Wintergreens,</hi> I mean for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in <hi>Yew, Fir,</hi> or <hi>Pine,</hi> eſpecially if thoſe Trees were aſſiſted by ſome Artificial heat, as being planted near ſome Stoves or Furnaces (if found that that would accord with their conſtitution) where heat was kept and conveyed to them all Winter long: For the Principles in any prolific Bud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet into motion, by being planted in any proper Stock, the Juyce of that Stock being warm'd by any adventitious heat, or what way ſo ever kept in action, becomes like a Soil fitted for them, whereby the aforeſaid Principles become fermental, and by a ſlow pac'd inteſtin colliſion becomes the eſſential cauſe, yea, is the very <hi>ratio formalis</hi> of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and growth, by which the Seed, like a ſeminal <hi>Faber,</hi> works until it have hew'd forth its own body, &amp; be cloth'd with all the ſhape, lineaments and proportions anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Antitype or latent-Idea couch'd in the central point, and exert all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers capable of emerging therefrom, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the intire form of the whole Plant or Tree.</p>

                  <p>In the generation of Animals from their ſeminaries, the aforeſaid Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples (if I miſtake not, <hi>Hydroph.</hi>) are no leſs <hi>(ſuo modo)</hi> conſpicuous, than what I have illuſtrated them to be in the production of Vegetables; and that both as they are Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples lock'd up in ſome minute portions of epitomiz'd matter, and likewiſe as they, being by requiſites duly concurring, put into motion, become fermental.</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:41852:35"/>
                  <p>For we account of Generation of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals no other than an evolution or natural expanſion of the implanted ſeminal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples contain'd in the minute <hi>Embrio,</hi> and rendred prolific by the fermental odour (if I may ſo ſay) of a maſculine Ferment; we cannot otherwiſe reckon, but that the nobleſt of fermental animal Juyces (in order to propagation) and where the ſpirits are moſt vigorous, and fecund, is the maſculine ſperm of Animals; which is a digeſted ſpermatic Elixir, capable of tinging thoſe more crude feminine Juyces, or a natural, but highly prepar'd liquid Magiſtery, circulated and brought on to maturity in its peculiar veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: yea, the very effloreſcence, (if I may further add) of Animal Juyces, impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at due ſeaſons with ſuch a ſtock of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, emerging from a fermentation proper to it ſelf, as renders it capable of inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe feminine <hi>ovaria,</hi> or uterine Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicles, with a ſubtile, but very active Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which awakens thoſe minute dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, and otherwiſe ſteril Embryo's, ſets them by its own vigorous action into a ſort of (if I may ſay) vegetative, or expanſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>It's not the groſs body of the prepar'd maſculine or ſeminal Sperm, or any viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble juice, or ſenſible part thereof (however
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41852:35"/>by circulation maturated) which is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the female Matrix, as the worthy <hi>Harvey</hi> excellently ſhews in his Tract, <hi>de generatione Animalium, Nihil in utero</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>poſt coitum invenias, generatura enim ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, brevi vel elabitur, vel evaneſcit: &amp; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men adſit aliquid, quod foeminam foecundam reddat;</hi> But it is a ſpirituous Ferment, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolis contagioſae</hi> (of which the ſeminal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor is but the Vehicle) at ſeaſons ſo heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, as it (if meeting with an aptneſs of Reception in the Female) breaths upon the oviformal Embryo, invigorates it into acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, putting thoſe implanted and cloſe ſhut up Principles into Motion.</p>
                  <p>For the aforeſaid induſtrious <hi>Harvey</hi> tells us, ſpeaking of what is contain'd in the Female Matrix, in order to Conception,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>So that in the propagation of all Animals
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41852:36"/>(the nobleſt, and for whoſe ſake the reſt were made, not excepted) the Embryo anchorite, or epitomiz'd Animal, ſhut up within the walls of each of the uterine Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicles, or oviformal Membranes, retains its juſt and proportionable form and ſhape, how minute ſoever in that ſeminary ovifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal original, inclos'd in the Female Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix: and only waits for an inſpiration from the active maſculine, ſpirituous, and fecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating Ferment, which is to ſtrike up thoſe dormant Principles, into an actual Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or animal fire, whereby the little Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo (the ſeminal Principles being once put into motion) begins (from a ſupply of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Juyces) by a fermental expanſion and evolution of its parts, to vegetate and grow bigger, till from thoſe rudiments, by a continual and ſucceſſive gradation, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal fire be ſtruck up: whereby the womb af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conception by the inſpiring of the preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant male Ferment is forthwith cloſe ſhut up; nature being ſo ſolicitous in this great affair of propagation, &amp; ſo wonderfully curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (both to prevent monſtrous Productions, as alſo multiplicity of contemporary Births from frequent &amp; inordinate Coitions) as that ſhe doth, after Conception, ſeal up the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix (as I may ſay) hermetically, that not the leaſt of Air, nor what is much more
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41852:36"/>ſubtile (<hi>viz.</hi> the Maſculine Ferment) can have the leaſt ingreſs; The Animal and Mineral Ferments herein conſpiring, that after impregnation of either (<hi>viz.</hi> of the Animal Embryo Juyce, or Mercurial Liquor) by their peculiar Seeds, the Matrix both Animal and Philoſophical are (I ſay) both, the one Hermetically to be clos'd up, the other naturally ſeal'd up, and kept from all heterogeneous aſſaults, whether in the Air or elſe-where, till in the one, it be brought on to the maturity of an Animal Life, and in the other, be elaborated to the perfection of the Philoſophic Elixir.

                  <p>But how the ſame Principles in their fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative Colliſions in the Animal Juyces, are the cauſe (other requiſites concurring) of the circulation of the Blood, the ſource of all Animal heat and warmth, the efficients of nouriſhment and growth: The cauſe of the generation of Spirits, and thence of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and Animal Functions (<hi>viz.</hi> Senſe and Motion) of the Body, how the Fountain of all the ſeveral Ferments in the peculiar Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Conduits of the Body.</p>

                  <p>But pray <hi>(Pyroph.)</hi> be not too conciſe in theſe great Matters: How in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular (according to your Principles) do you underſtand concerning the faculty of the Stomach, you call the Ferment thereof, which doth perform ſuch wonderful effects? doth it by its innate heat according to our Philoſophy) or by its acid Ferment, as of late ſeveral <hi>Neoterics</hi> have thought, or by ſome latent quality unknown to us: For it ſeems to be of a ſtrange penetrating nature, as to be able to turn all the ſeveral ſorts of Food into a <hi>Cremor,</hi> and thence fit it for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preparation in order to blood and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pyroph.</speaker>
                  <p>True <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> the work of the Stomach (let it be done by what Agent it will) is wonderful, and in that very thing Nature's path is very myſterious. That it conſiſts not in an innate heat, is evident, firſt, becauſe no degree of heat of what pitch ſoever imagin'd can perform the like Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Reductions of Bodys. And ſecondly, becauſe all heat is (according to our Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis) the reſult of Fermentation, and there fore wherever the heat of the body was which is the conſtant effect of the inteſtin ſtruglings of the Principles contained in the Animal Juyces, there would it neceſſarily follow that it ſhould perform the like opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41852:37"/>in every part where it's found, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant obſervation contradicts the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, therefore heat is not the cauſe of that diſſolving action of the Stomach: And that it conſiſts not in an acid Ferment (the more plauſible of the two) will be evident from the depoſition of what we conclude it to be. Laſtly, that it is not from an occult quality will be clear from what we ſhall afterwards diſcourſe of the inexiſtency (and therefore futility) of qualities.</p>
                  <p>But how, I ſay, a pure ſubtiliz'd Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is continually elaborated into a moſt depurate and refin'd Elixir, containing the moſt defecate Principles of the blood and aliment, whence blood is prepar'd, is by circulation conveyed from the blood into the Stomach, by the Gaſtric, and perhaps other Arteries, inſerted into the Ventricle, where through the congenealneſs to our every day receiv'd alimental Juyce, can (by reaſon of its ſubtilty of parts) penetrate, diſſolve, and unlock the compage of ſuch alimentary bodys, and at length put them into a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motion, by ſtriking up their eſſential Principles into an inteſtin Colliſion, which is that very thing we call a Ferment, and is therefore here (according to our Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis) the true cauſe of the ſtomachical Ferment, that great and almoſt univerſal <hi>Alkaheſt</hi> of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41852:38"/>nature, that can diſſolve bodys, though of many different ſorts of Textures, where the ſame Principles are to be found which eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially more or leſs conſtitute all alimenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Concretes and Liquids too.</p>
                  <p>For I muſt tell you <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> that the congenealneſs of Principles of bodys under very different Textures and various Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages, give the cauſe of their more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſolution by <hi>Menſtruums</hi> prepar'd analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically thereto, yea and give the reaſon why the Principles of one are brought into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the action of the other; that is, by the congruouſneſs of the Principles of the ſolvent to thoſe of the ſolvend.</p>
                  <p>So that how the Ferment of the Stomach conſiſts not in an implanted acid, nor any other native Ferment, peculiarly inherent in that part: But how it chiefly (if not ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) owes its original to the circulation of the aforeſaid highly prepared, and much elaborated Elixir of the blood, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the foreſaid ducts, by its great penetrability and agility eaſily mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the aſſum'd aliment, and by the aſſimilation of Principles ſets the whole maſs into a fermentative motion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by taketh in pieces its Compage by a genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine ſolution: For the univerſal conſtitution of all alimentary bodys, and by which they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41852:38"/>all agree in ſomewhat that is common amongſt them, conſiſts in ſome texture or other of the two grand Principles, Acid and Sulphur: which fermentative Motion, I ſay, of the Principles by further ſolution, perco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſeparation, and afterwards by yet more intimate commixtion is carried on to the preparing the blood and ſpirits, and thence to the elaborating the aforeſaid vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Elixir, which conveyed into the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, compleats the whole round of dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, and performs the whole circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion compatible to Animals in their great work of nouriſhment and preparation of ſpirits in order to Senſe and Motion, and other functions peculiar to animal bodys: how, I ſay, all this is perform'd by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious colliſions and elaborations of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Principles, what we only hint here, we diſcourſe more at large in our <hi>Tentamen Phyſiolog.</hi> to which we refer you.</p>

                  <p>The fifth, is when the Principles after they are by the moſt rapid Colliſion brought to an ignition, are tranſmitted from their own into other Bodies, where

                  <p>When I accounted Fire amongſt the extrinſic Agents, it was only as Culina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>viz.</hi> the vulgar (I mean ſuch as our fourth complication of the Principles exhibits) and as conſidered applicable to Bodies already conſtituted, and to the changes thence iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that is, as the Principles of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible Body was by a rapid Colliſion brought into that higheſt motion we call Fire, as theſe I ſay were applicable to other Bodies (whoſe Principles in ſome Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or other had woven the Texture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſo lay dormant,) and did as adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Agents, excite the latent Principles into action, ſo they thereby become extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic Agents: thus the Fiery or combuſtible Principles being put into action in one Body, as ſuppoſe Wood or the like, this as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic Agent, is able to excite the ſame combuſtible Principles in any other combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Body.</p>

For although moſt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, (eſpecially Vegetable and Animal) lodge within themſelves, their own Ferments; by which they undergo that inteſtin motion of their conſtitutive parts, they are natually inclin'd to, as appears in the Vegetation of Plants, from the Fermentation of their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Principles; and in the Motion, Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Generation of Spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Fermentative Juices of Animals, yet theſe are

                  <p>I look upon them <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> as other ſorts of extrinſick Agents, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to, and interweaving with other Bodies beget great alterations in their apparences: Thus for inſtance, <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> which is a fluid Body, doth by the interpoſition of Salts (as of <hi>Vitriol, Nitre,</hi> or <hi>Foſſil</hi> Salt) ariſe together by the help of Fire in the form of a white Cryſtalline Sublimate, when from the apparences of a fluid Body, and <hi>Argent</hi>-Colour, it becomes determin'd by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid interweaving of Salts into a conſiſtent,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41852:46"/>ſolid, and white Body; as may be ſeen in the preparation of <hi>Mercury</hi> Sublimate both <hi>Corroſive</hi> and <hi>Dulcis:</hi> which ſolid Body ſhall become fluid again as Water, by the help of Fire, if thereto be added <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> and filings of <hi>Copper,</hi> or the <hi>Calx</hi> of <hi>Verdigreece,</hi> remaining after the diſtillation of that <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Veneris,</hi> ſo called by <hi>Snelfer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus alſo two <hi>Saline</hi> fluid Liquors, (the one made by putrefaction and Diſtillation, either from Animals or Vegetables, the other by diſtillation prepared from Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Liquors) put together, ſhall loſe their fluidity, and become a dry <hi>Oſta;</hi> as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, not only in the well known mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Spirit of Wine, and Spirit of Urin, Blood, <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> Plants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but alſo two Mineral Liquors (mentioned in our <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lolog.

                  <p>Becauſe, as I ſaid, Fire (<hi>viz.</hi> the vulgar) made from the fourth Complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Principles, was applicable to

                  <p>Thus Ferments are compriz'd chiefly in the ſecond and third Complications of the Principles; and Solvents in as much as they depend (for the moſt part) upon the Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation of the Principles, do moſt-what reſult from the ſixth.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt difficulty I find, is in Salts as Agents, and in petrific Concretes, <hi>viz.</hi> how Salts in their concretions, and Stones in their nativity, are compriſable within the ſphere of our Principles, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to our Hypotheſis; concerning Salts, how they all in their ſeveral concretions comprehend a Sulphur, in one degree, mode, or other, lockt up in their Compage; And how a ten-fold complication of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Salts are neceſſarily to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in order to all the various Concretions, they are in Nature or by Art (in imitation of Nature) reducible to, and concerning the

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41852:54"/>the fumes go into Air, the expreſſed moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Wood is of the nature of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Aſhes is of the nature of Earth: and laſtly the Fire or Flame is obvious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the Eye.</p>

                  <speaker>Pyroph.</speaker>
                  <p>This experiment of the burning of Wood, evinceth nothing, <hi>Hydroph.</hi> of the pre-exiſtency of the <hi>Quaternary</hi> of Elements, by its reduction into Fume, Moiſture, Aſhes and Flame: For that by which (according to the <hi>Peripatetie</hi> Doctrine) you would have Air to be demonſtrated to be a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Principle of Wood, is the fume: which if ſo, then muſt this Fume be like the Air a ſimple <hi>Homogenial</hi> Body, which yet how ſimple ſo ever you may repute, we know <hi>Hydroph.</hi> how to ſeparate by the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotechnic</hi> Art, five or ſix ſeveral diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things: as if done in cloſe Veſſels, a four Spirit; if openly, it ſeparates a ſoot to the ſides of the Chimney, as of a great recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: from which we have ſeparated a Phlegm, Spirit, Volatile-Salt, Oyl, and <hi>Caput Mort.</hi> enough to make it juſtly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the being a ſimple Elementary Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and therefore ſome do two things at once, <hi>(viz.)</hi> both char their Wood, and at the ſame condenſe the Fumes in large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers or pipes, whereby they get the four Spirit: For the charing of the Wood, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41852:55"/>but a fixation of the Sulphur, with the Salt: which Sulphur before would flame forth, but now being ſmothered, it only glows in the Coal.</p>
                  <p>So that that whereby you would demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate a reduction of Wood into the Element of Air, by the Fumes thereof, you ſee <hi>(Hydro.)</hi> how we find it to be a mixt Body it ſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of <hi>Heterogeneous</hi> parts, many of which are further reducible into more primary Principles; yea even the very acid Spirit, made by diſtillation of Woods, as of <hi>Guaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, Box,</hi> &amp;c. Which one would deem (if any) to be a ſimple Liquor, is yet by additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Alkalizate</hi> Bodies, ſuch as are <hi>Coral, Crabs-Eyes, Pearl,</hi> fixt Salts of Herbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is reducible into a piercing Liquor quite of another ſort than before, which I have alſo obſerv'd from the acid Spirit of <hi>Verdigreaſe</hi> dinted or mortified by a fixt <hi>Alcali,</hi> to have by further diſtillation, been reducible into a quick penetrating Spirit, not acid at all, but very much emulating the Spirit of crude <hi>Tartar;</hi> which will not (as Acids uſually do) change the Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> into a red Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;</p>
                  <p>And as to what you ſay <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> that the expreſſed moiſture in burning the Wood, is of the nature of Water: this very thing I ſay has an <hi>Empyreumatic</hi> odour, which is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41852:55"/>further reducible, and therefore forfeits its badge of a primary or Elementary Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: As for the remaining Aſhes, which you ſuppoſe to be of the nature of Earth, you are miſtaken, for they are a great part of them ſeparable in the form of a fixt Salt, which is quite another thing than that you call Earth.</p>
                  <p>And further, that this very Earth ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble after the <hi>Calcination</hi> of the Vegetable and <hi>Elixiviation</hi> of the Salt, is not Elementary, will be evident from the following experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Obſervation: for from about 200 weight of <hi>Oak</hi>-wood, firſt char'd, and then burnt to Aſhes, I had but 3 pound of Aſhes, which by <hi>Lixiviating</hi> gave me 5 ounces of fixt Salt and about 2 pound 8 ounces of inſipid Earth: which very Earth I ſay was no more to be accounted an Elementary Principle of the aforeſaid Wood, than fixt Salt thence produc'd by <hi>Calcination,</hi> becauſe the like quantity of Wood being otherwiſe handled by Fire (beſides what different products would reſult from other Agents) <hi>viz.</hi> by a naked firing (without any previous charing) gives a larger proportion by much of fixt Salt, than the former; which very fixt Salt, may alſo by frequent <hi>Calcination, Solution, Filtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Evaporation</hi> or <hi>Diſtillation,</hi> may I ſay, be all converted into an Earth (the ſame the

                  <p>WEll <hi>(Pyroph.)</hi> but we do not ſuppoſe that all mixts are immediately reducible into the four Elements; but many bodys firſt change into other forms, by a kind of viciſſitude, and yet at the laſt are reſolvable into the four Elements, of which they conſiſt: Thus Herbs, and other Food, we take for our nouriſhment, undergo various changes, in our Bodys, into Chyle, Blood, Fleſh, Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and after Excretion, is converted into a Stercus, which at length is reſolv'd into Earth.</p>

                  <p>It's true, <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> let us ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin what Hypotheſis we pleaſe, yet are not concrete bodys always immediately redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible into their firſt conſtituent Principles, but ſometimes undergo a tranſpoſition of parts, whereby they acquire a new form, and ſo a ſecond, third, and ſo on in a round of viciſſitudes, before there happen a total Analyſis into its primitive Principles or through-reſolution of a Concrete into its <hi>Minima.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that this ultimate reduction of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes, ſhould always at the long run, prove
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41852:57"/>the four Elements, is not me-thinks <hi>(Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droph.)</hi> demonſtrable by your propounded inſtance of Herbs, or other Aliment, taken into our bodys, for nouriſhment: For that they admit of various Mutations, according to the different digeſtions they paſs through, is that we cannot deny; but that theſe ſhould be intermediate changes of our Food, before it be ultimately reduc'd, into the Quaternary of Elements; is that we are not to let ſlip unexamined.</p>
                  <p>And firſt we are to conſider, that towards the making of changes amongſt bodys, out of one form into another; where there is the ſame material Principles ſubſtituted, and only a Metaſtaſis happens; there muſt, I ſay, of neceſſity concur the ſuper-induction of new Ferments (or other ſorts of extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic Agents, as aforeſaid) which by mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, ſubjugating, and altering the parts, may raiſe up a new Structure of a different form, than was before, and yet that body no whit the nearer to a reduction into its Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments now than before.</p>
                  <p>So that what changes, or alterations our Food undergoes in the ſeveral digeſtions of our bodys, are to be aſcrib'd to no other than the different Ferments it paſſeth through; which altering the texture of the parts, ſubverts the firſt, and bringeth on a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41852:57"/>new form; ſo from the form of Beef, Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Bread, Beer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (though different amongſt themſelves) yet by the uniform operation of the Spirituous, elixerated Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Blood, thither in its circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion tranſmitted as aforeſaid, become alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or tranſmuted into a ſimilar Chyle, or <hi>Cremor,</hi> which being refin'd through the ſtrait Colanders of the <hi>Venae lacteae,</hi> by which it is percolated from the dreggy <hi>Feces</hi> along the <hi>Duodenum, Colon,</hi> and <hi>Ilion,</hi> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purify'd in the Glandules, is ſent up by the Thoracical Veſſels, into the Jugulars, where it's let into the aſcending Branch of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> becomes daſht with blood, and by coming to the Heart, where, by the Air in its circuit through the Lungs, it's volatiz'd, and aſſumes the form of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal blood; which being carried along the <hi>Aorta,</hi> and other thence branching Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſublimes or diſtils into pure volatile Spirits, for the ſupply of the <hi>genus Nervo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum;</hi> part of which mean while being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the whole habit of the body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes coagulated in the fibrous parts, into Sinews, Fleſh, Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according as it is determin'd, and arreſted by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular aſſimilative Ferments of the ſeveral parts.</p>
                  <p>Next to which <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> we are to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41852:58"/>conſider, the humane as well as other mixt bodys, during the revolution of their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical Ferments, are in a conſtant perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rability; always (I mean during the ſeaſon of the vigour of their genuine Ferments) a making up, and as often reſolving, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in pieces, <hi>(viz.)</hi> in a perpetual flux of conſtituent Elements; otherwiſe what means the continual ſupply we have from daily nouriſhment, by freſh Food? For if there were not a conſtant flux, and waſting by perſpiration, we need not ſo conſtant a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply by Food.</p>
                  <p>In as much as when we come to a full maturity of years, as to the Vegetation, or growth of our bodys; which is from 18 or 20 till towards 30 years (ſome ſooner, others later) Then what ever of Food we take in (deducting what is ſeparated, as Urin, Excrements, and the like) as much, I ſay, of real nouriſhment, as is by the dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive Ferments daily made thereof, ſo much do we tranſpire, and looſe: ſo that ſuppoſing by compute, that in moſt bodys, every day (I mean while in health, and Ferments ſtrong) 7, 8, or 10 ounces of freſh blood may be produc'd: and yet notwithſtanding ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe moſt men to be weighed at 24, 26, or at furtheſt 30 years of age (excepting ſome few that may by the more than ordinary
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41852:58"/>coagulation of that which ſhould tranſpire, after thoſe years, grow fat, and groſs) and again at 40, 50, or 60 years, it will be found, that generally there is no increaſe of weight at all during that time; and yet, I ſay, ſo much blood is ſpent every day in nouriſhment, and ſo much of the ultimate aſſimilated aliment is daily tranſpired, and all this without any reſidence, or <hi>caput mort.</hi> of the blood, being conſtantly (whilſt the Ferments, Spirits, and Organs are ſound and regular) volatiz'd by a Ferment from the Air.</p>
                  <p>And yet this Blood is made from various kinds of Fleſh, Fowl, Fiſh, Bread, Drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which loſe their priſtine form by the power of the ſpecifical Ferments, through which they paſs: ſo that if I ſhould tell you <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> that when we come to 20, or 30 years of age, and ſo on, we have not the ſame numerical bodys as we had in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; nay, perhaps not the ſame we had 5 year ago, you will think it a <hi>Paradox</hi> (if not <hi>Heterodox</hi>) and yet if fairly ſcan'd, what, I ſay, will not be found impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
                  <p>For if we duely conſider, how that which yeſterday appear'd in the form of part of a Sheep, Calf, Ox, Deer, Pidgeon, Gooſe, Turkey, Corn, Herbs, Beer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41852:59"/>day be tranſmuted into Chyle, Blood, Fleſh, Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of a humane Body; yea, this to tranſpire within a few days, and aſſume other forms, and all this, by the power of Ferments, which are as the noble <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith, the parents of Tranſmutation.</p>
                  <p>If the nutritive parts of our body was not in a conſtant flux, and always winding off, we ſhould in time become <hi>Anakites,</hi> grow to be mighty Gyants: But from the vigour of the Ferments of the body, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a perſpirability communicated from the Air, the ſucculent, yea the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid parts themſelves, are always upon the wing.</p>
                  <p>Thus as new parts are daily by a rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ferments added, ſo the old as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly march off, or wear away: or rather as the former texture of parts by a perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility wind off, ſo new parts by freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Food (paſſing the circle of Ferments) are woven on: to confirm which, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Ferments wind off the old, and wind on the new coming parts of added Nutriment; appears by this Obſervation, that old Cows or Oxen, after they have done their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſervice, being put to feed at freſh Graſs, do by the power of the aforeſaid Ferments, lay on new fleſh, which eats as tenderly, as if the Goods had been kill'd
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41852:59"/>young: ſo that that which ſolely determines matter, in this grand circulation of bodys, out of one ſhape into another, are the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal and ſpecifical Ferments, and during the vigour of theſe the form of the body is kept intire in its ſpecifical difference from other concrete bodys.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the ſame ſpecifical Body, after the revolution of ſome years, is no more the ſame numerical Body, than the Ship which went from <hi>Athens,</hi> and by frequent repairs return'd at laſt without one foot of old Timber, that it was at firſt built with, may be ſaid to be the ſame.</p>

                  <p>To which I return <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> that although our Bodies conſiſt in a conſtant flux of Parts; and that nutrition is an appoſition of new, in the place of the old, or tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Particles; yet as the form of this circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating matter is determin'd by the ſeminal, and therefore ſpecifical Ferments; ſo the decaying of our Bodies, both by ſickneſs and old Age, depend Eſſentially upon the intenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and remiſneſs of the vigour of thoſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41852:60"/>Ferments: ſo that when theſe grow <hi>languid</hi> by diſeaſes, the Body waſts by a <hi>Maraſmus;</hi> or when they at the long run of old Age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come infeebled, and draw towards their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, according to the great and irrevocable decree of the Almighty, <hi>Statutum eſt omnibus ſemel mori;</hi> then do they come to their <hi>peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od,</hi> as to their <hi>Progreſſive</hi> motion, (I mean in order to nouriſhment, and ſupport of the Body thereby) and leaves the Body to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in pieces, either by a <hi>Putredinous</hi> Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, promoted by acceſs of Air; or by the <hi>Fracedinous</hi> odour of the Grave: whereby it's either tranſmitted into other Animals, (by the power of their Ferments) or reduced into its primitive Juice, or <hi>Leffas</hi> of the Earth; For the ſtrength, floridneſs, activity, and that which is commonly called the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Body, depends moſtwhat if not ſolely upon the vigour of the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as you may ſee further in our <hi>Hydrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia Chymica,</hi> and <hi>Zymologia Phyſica.</hi>

                  <p>To which I anſwer, <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> that as the Ferments are the <hi>primary</hi> active and <hi>tranſmutative</hi> Principles, to which the moſt incident <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of diſeaſes are chiefly reducible: ſo what alterations are made in the Body, by the <hi>Ataxy</hi> of Diſeaſes are moſtwhat referrable thereto: ſo that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes happen not to the Body, as it falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our conſideration, in the notion of a conſtant flux, and viciſſitude of parts; but as it is compos'd of a round of Ferments, whoſe exorbitances, prevarications, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent errours, become Eſſential to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting Diſeaſes: And therefore although the Body as to its material conſtitutive Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, may admit of a conſtant alteration of parts in an <hi>Agil fluor,</hi> yet doth it not follow that Diſeaſes are alſo as conſtantly worn off; becauſe they belong to the Body as conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red under its Claſſis of Ferments: ſo that as the Ferments in their vigour are the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the <hi>Eutaxy</hi> or due temperament of humors, and conſequently of Health; in like manner their <hi>ſpurious</hi> exorbitances, are the eſſential cauſes of thoſe diſorders, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſures in the Body we call Diſeaſes.</p>

                  <p>Whence it's evident, moiſture is no qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity at all; from the aforeſaid reaſon of its being really and eſſentially Water, either in a fluid or extended form; as you may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee in our <hi>Hydrologia Chymica.</hi> So that moiſture is only and primarily competible to the thin woven Texture of the parts of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter circulating in the Air, and to the Air but ſecundary, as the <hi>Vehicle</hi> of the extended Body of Water.</p>

                  <p>I look upon Air <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> to be ſuch a parcel of matter, whoſe parts conſiſt in a <hi>tenuious, diaphanous,</hi> pliable and fluid Texture, of eaſie receſs, ſuſceptible of the impreſſions of the minuteſt of Bodies, and capable of permitting rarified Waters, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours and all ſorts of <hi>Apporrhoea</hi> from the <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raqueous.</hi> Globe to paſs and repaſs: of all which, and many other minute Bodies that fall not under the perception of our ſenſes, it is the proper <hi>Vehicle,</hi> alſo ſubſervient to the motion of all Bodies that tack to and fro within its Orb, is the <hi>Vehicle</hi> of Species, the <hi>medium</hi> of all influences and tranſactions betwixt the <hi>Coeleſtial</hi> and <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> Bodies: And as <hi>Triſmegiſtus</hi> in <hi>Aſclepio,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Aer eſt organum vel machina omnium, per quam om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia fiunt,</hi> not as an Element, but as a Machine for the motion of all Bodies.</p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:41852:63"/>
                  <p>Its parts I ſay are <hi>tenuious,</hi> that it may the better give way to the motion of Bodies, within its <hi>orbit;</hi> of eaſie receſs, that it may the better admit of other rarified Bodies, which are in a continual circulation, and thoſe perforations to be of no prefixt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, but either round, or angular, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the preſſure of its parts by the motion of other Bodies; <hi>Diaphanous,</hi> that it may the better tranſmit the Rays of lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Bodies; <hi>pliable,</hi> I ſaid, that it may be the more ſubſervient to the juſtlings of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and may the better recede upon the acceſs of other moveables; and laſtly, fluid, that it may thereby prevent any large <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum,</hi> and may the better preſs into the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſities</hi> of Bodies; Thus a ſtone being caſt at a diſtance, which by the impulſe it has got, draws, ſuppoſe, a ſtraigt line in the Air, force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome parts of the Air, and thoſe preſs upon the next adjacent, and thoſe the next, till by a circulating motion they fall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly into the rear of the deſerted ſpace, made by the motion of the ſtone, and ſo immediately ſupplies the vacancy thereof, and thereby contributes to the perpetuating the firſt impulſe from a hand, Sling, or Engine; For if the Air did not conſtantly ſucceed by a circular motion, cloſe in the rear of the moveable, the impulſe would immediately
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41852:64"/>flag, and the motion of the Body ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>And although <hi>Democritus</hi> his two grand ingredients of the world were <hi>Atoms,</hi> and that which he calls <hi>vacuum</hi> or <hi>inane,</hi> which was nothing elſe but what we in the verge of our <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> call Air, and above is <hi>Aether;</hi> yet certainly, although the parts of Air, are ſo <hi>tenuious,</hi> and <hi>diaphanous,</hi> as never to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come viſible to our eyes, yet I ſay, may no leſs be reputed matter, (in how different a Texture ſoever) than that which enters the compoſition of natural Bodies, as genuine Elements thereof.</p>

                  <p>Theſe are general conſiderations of Air, as it falls in a large ſenſe under our apprehenſion: But pray <hi>(Pyroph.)</hi> how do you apprehend of it in a more ſtrict and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſenſe, in order to the intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of Animals and Vegetables, which ſeem to have ſome near dependance thereon, both as to their Generation, Conſervation in their Species, and <hi>Metaſtaſis</hi> too.</p>

                  <p>Not ſo general conſiderations <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> as you may perhaps take them to be, but may many of them very well ſerve to ſome <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of both Animals, Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and other Bodies, as they fall under a Philoſophick inquiry; for that it ſhould by its <hi>tenuious,</hi> plyable, fluid Texture, be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the motion of Bodies, is thereby no
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41852:64"/>leſs ſerviceable, as for the general ſo the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular concerns of Animals and Vegetables, both by concurring to the <hi>Motion, Senſation, Secretion,</hi> and <hi>Perſpiration</hi> of Animals; as alſo by promoting the motion and Vegetation of Vegetables; and that too as it is perfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diaphanous admitting both of lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous as well as other Bodies which circulate in its Orb, for the helping forward <hi>Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Vegetation,</hi> and all this by invigora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Eſſential Ferments of both, which its congenial aſſociate the <hi>Volatile nitrous</hi> Salt, and <hi>Aetherial</hi> matter hid therein.</p>
                  <p>Without which, the functions of <hi>Vitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> could not be perform'd, for without thoſe jointly concurring, neither would the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be actuated, the parts perſpirable the Taper of Life ſet a flaming, nor in fine the Body moveable without the help of that <hi>Organum,</hi> as <hi>Triſmegiſtus</hi> calls it: which is further evident by what improvements, the great Naturaliſt, Eſq; <hi>Boyle,</hi> hath made in the lately invented <hi>Pneumatick</hi> Engine, into which if Animals be put, and the Air pumpt forth, they fall into Palpitations and in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little time, for want of the help of this Eſſential <hi>Organum,</hi> the Ferments are damp'd, the Spirits run counter, flag, and the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Life is quickly extinct, ſo that they ſpeedily die of <hi>Spaſms</hi> and <hi>Convulſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:41852:65"/>
                  <p>And as the Air with its <hi>Volatile</hi> Salt, is an Eſſential Machine (not as an Element) neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to promote (if not alſo to excite) the Functions of Vitality in Animals; ſo it is no leſs effectual, in the invigorating the ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ferments of Vegetables: For neither are theſe brought on to maturity, nor do they grow without the concurrence thereof; Inaſmuch as the ſuperficies of the Earth, which is the Matrix or Nurſery of Vegetable Seeds, is porous and ſpongy, whereby the Air has acceſs to Seeds, even in their firſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and beginnings to motion; concurring to the firſt workings, of the ſeminal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, by putting the Springs &amp; Ferments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Action; and when they by the Vegetative Colliſion of their Principles put forth, or ſpring out of the Earth, ſtill require the aſſiſting influence of this fluid <hi>Aereal</hi> matter, of which if they be denied, their Ferments ceaſe to act, and the Body withers.</p>
                  <p>And as to what you ask <hi>(Hydrop.)</hi> how the Air is concern'd in the <hi>Metaſtaſis</hi> of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, out of one ſhape into another; I anſwer, that new Ferments are ſuper-induc'd upon Bodies, for the mutation thereof, by the mediation of Air, whereby the ſeminal Principles, which by their inteſtine and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive</hi> Colliſions have been the Mechanical Agents in the Production and <hi>Geneſis</hi> of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41852:65"/>do now, by the <hi>ſuperinduction</hi> of new Ferments, from the Air, fall into other ſorts (I mean <hi>Retrogreſſive</hi>) Colliſions, thereby takes the ſame Body (they built before) now in pieces by a putredinous Ferment;</p>
                  <p>For if ſome Bodies can but be ſecur'd from the Air (or from what is contain'd in the Air) before a putrid Ferment be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, (that is, before the Principles be put into their reverſe motion,) they may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd intire in their form: the truth of which, may be confirm'd by ſeveral Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal inſtances: For beſides the <hi>Additaments</hi> of <hi>Salts, Sugars,</hi> and <hi>Vinegars,</hi> wherewith many ſorts of things, as food and all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections may be preſerv'd a conſiderable time for uſe: and beſides the Occluſions of the Pores of ſome Bodies, eſpecially <hi>Pullen</hi> and the like, killed and hung up in the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whereby thoſe Bodies may be kept intire from putrefaction by the Froſt Air, as they preſerve their kill'd <hi>Pullen</hi> for ſeveral Months ſweet and good, in <hi>New-England;</hi> I ſay, beſides all theſe, I know a peculiar Artifice of preſerving <hi>Aprecocks, Damſens, Gooſeberries, Cherries,</hi> &amp;c. without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of any thing, ſave a skilful contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of excluding the Air: of which more in our <hi>Zymolog. Phyſic.</hi> and <hi>Tentamen Phyſiologic.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus alſo Quinces by taking forth the Core
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41852:66"/>which boyl'd with ſome other <hi>Quinces</hi> to a <hi>Mucilage,</hi> with which they are to be fill'd, and put into a cloſe Veſſel, fill'd round with the ſame <hi>Mucilage,</hi> will preſerve them intire in their form for a whole year; ſo fleſh kept in a conſtant current of Water, or in Spirit of Wine, will be preſerv'd a long time in its intire form, as ſometimes a Puppy has been kept intire, and <hi>Embrio's</hi> are preſerved from any putrid Ferment in Spirit of Wine. Alſo Beef ſeaſon'd and well bak'd, and put in a Cask fill'd with deſpum'd Butter, has thereby been kept good in long Voyages: Thus by imbalming, Fumes, and Searcloths, Cadaverous Bodies are kept a great while from putrefaction: alſo by a conſtant heat the ſame Bodies may be <hi>Mummiz'd,</hi> witneſs the Bodies both of Men and Beaſts in ſandy Deſerts (as thoſe of <hi>Arabia</hi>) being covered over with Sands by whirl-winds or Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes, are by the heat of the Sun (conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beating upon them) and by being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Air, turn'd into <hi>Mummy,</hi> found unbar'd by other contrary Winds.</p>
                  <p>So that you ſee hence <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> how Bodies are prevented of their otherwiſe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Metaſtaſis</hi> into other ſhapes, either by additional <hi>Saline</hi> or other ſorts of <hi>Condiments</hi> Liquors, Steams, &amp;c. or other more ſolitary Excluſions of Air; all which do anticipate
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41852:66"/>the ſudden <hi>Analyſis</hi> of Bodies, (which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happen from new putredinous Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) by arreſting and ſuſpending the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Bodies in their <hi>Fermentative</hi> Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: wherefore you ſee that the Air is not only of general but particular concern, as in the production and conſervation of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and Vegetables, ſo alſo in the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or putredinous <hi>Analyſis</hi> of them into other forms.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all which <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> we are to conſider the Air as the common <hi>Vehicle</hi> of Heat, Cold, and Moiſture, not as Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are Eſſential to Air, as their <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum inhaeſionis,</hi> but as actual Bodies, how minute ſoever, are capable enough to ſmite our ſubtile Organs, and affect our Senſes, ſet on work by Winds from different quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which are the <hi>Clavigeri tempeſtatum</hi> in order to the mutation of weather.</p>
                  <p>For although theſe float in the Air and are not ſeen, (excepting that of Moiſture ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in a Miſt, Fog, or Cloud) yet that they are perceptible enough to our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is evident amongſt the reſt, from the <hi>minute Particles</hi> of Cold, which float in the Air from <hi>Northern</hi> Winds, and are of ſuch Shape, or Size, as they not only pierce our Skins, and moderately ſhut the Pores there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, thereby invigorate the Ferments, whence
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41852:67"/>our Appetites to Food are ſtronger, and the Digeſtions the better perform'd in Froſt than in warm Weather. And in colder Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Climates, than in hot, but in cold raw Weather the Pores (thoſe ſmall Portals of the Body) ſtand a char (if I may ſo ſay) whereby the alterations in the Air have the eaſier acceſs into our Juices, to procure the like in them; whence we obſerve, in ſuch Weather people generally take more cold, and are more prone to Diſeaſes, as well Acute as Chronical, than at other Seaſons.</p>
                  <p>Which Froſt Air, if it be very ſharp, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geals the fluid humours of our Bodies, force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirits to a retreat unleſs oppos'd by a warmth from exerciſe or Spirits of good Liquor, yea the ſame cold <hi>Particles</hi> meeting with Water, doth ſo fill the Pores thereof, that from a fluid, they (by their interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) make it become for a time a kind of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Body: which when the winds change, and are carried in different <hi>Percledi</hi> of the Air, as breathing, ſuppoſe from the <hi>South,</hi> or <hi>Weſt, South-Eaſt,</hi> or <hi>South-Weſt</hi> points, the <hi>Particles</hi> of Heat and Moiſture muſter in the Air, and mortifie, dint or reſolve the cold <hi>Particles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it's very probable that the congealing of Water into Ice by Cold, is nothing elſe but the congelation of the <hi>Atoms</hi> (which in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41852:67"/>one Senſe we admit) of Cold, rivetting themſelves faſt in the Pores of the Body of Water, in as much as theſe floating in the Air, either brought to us by thoſe Winds which blow over the <hi>Northern</hi> Frozen Seas, which in their reſolution may extricate themſelves from their former combinations, being carried by the fanning of the Wind from that quarter, or from what other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſoever, meeting with liquid Bodies, by their piercing nature inſinuate themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Texture thereof, and as they weave themſelves in, they put a ſtop to the motion or fluidity of thoſe liquids, unleſs preſerv'd by ſome active, nimble, ſpirituous parts, and from a fluid make them become (as we ſaid) a ſort of ſolid Bodies; which as they fill ſome Pores of Water, ſo they cauſe ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of Water to conſtringe or concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves; whence is one reaſon, why in Froſty Seaſons, Rivers (that are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe high by late falls of Rain) are upon Froſty Winds ſhrunk up, and Water in Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels expos'd to the Air, are ſenſibly contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or leſſened.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore all Bodies whoſe Texture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts moſt what of liquid parts, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo many of thoſe aforeſaid nimble, <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous, fermentative Particles,</hi> by the briskneſs of whoſe motion, the liquids are kept fluid,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41852:68"/>then are they ſecured (ſo long as kept either circulating in their own, or defended by cloſe Veſſels) from the injury of the cold, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo no coagulation therefrom, nor are altered thereby; Thus the Blood, and liquid Juices in the Body of Man or other Animals, as long as they are invigorated with <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Saline</hi> and <hi>Sulphureous</hi> parts, which keep them conſtantly in a circulating Motion, ſo long are ſafe from the injury of cold: ſo all Fermented Liquors, whether <hi>Wines, Sider, Perry, Ale, Beer,</hi> &amp;c. while the Ferments are active, with <hi>Spirituous</hi> parts interwoven in the whole Texture thereof, and kept in cloſe Veſſels, ſo long are not apt to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd by cold, or to be congeal'd thereby into Ice: unleſs through the exceſſiveneſs of Cold, and perhaps careleſneſs in ſtopping up Veſſels, Wines or other Fermented Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors become Frozen, as ſometimes happens upon very long Voiages into cold Climates, witneſs that of Fiſhing for <hi>Whales,</hi> by ſome <hi>Hollanders</hi> in the <hi>Northern</hi>-Seas, their Wines (otherwiſe generous enough) were by extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of cold Frozen, the Hoops being taken off, and the VVines uncask'd, they were found congeal'd into Ice, and ſtood in the form of the Veſſels they were put in: which Ice they perforated with Augers, and found about the Center of the Ice, a little Liquor
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41852:68"/>of an <hi>Amethyſt</hi> Colour, which was the pure <hi>Balſamick</hi> Spirits of Wine concentred, and therefore incapable of being congeal'd by cold: all the reſt of the Body of Ice, being diſſolv'd by Heat, was an inſipid Phlegm or mere VVater of VVine, into which if a little of the true Fiery Spirits was pour'd, made it like VVine, after which manner they drank it.</p>
                  <p>And in our late intenſe Froſt, <hi>December</hi> laſt, the <hi>Particles</hi> of Cold were ſo copious, and piercing, as it froze <hi>Beer</hi> and <hi>Ale</hi> in Cakes, <hi>Sherry Sack</hi> in Bottles, and a <hi>Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium</hi> of Vegetable Salts I had by me; yea a pretty ſmart Spirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> ſtanding in a Bottle in a VVindow, was as far as I could diſcern totally Frozen up: and in <hi>York-ſhire</hi> in ſome places, it froze the moiſture in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Noſtrils, into Icicles, that with their finger (as an Eye-witneſs told me) they pull'd out pieces of Ice.</p>
                  <p>So all <hi>Volatile</hi> Spirits, whether <hi>Vinous, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinous,</hi> or <hi>Oleaginous</hi> are (being kept in cloſe Veſſels) capable of defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from being congeal'd by cold. For neither Spirits of VVine, or <hi>Volatile</hi> Spirits of <hi>Blood, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin, Soot, Harts-horn,</hi> &amp;c. nor diſtill'd (therefore call'd) <hi>Chymical</hi>-Oyls, as of <hi>Turpentine, Cinamon, Cloves, Roſemary, Sage, Wormwood,</hi> &amp;c. are I ſay none of them
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41852:69"/>apt to be Frozen by Cold, but can defend themſelves, by their nimble, active, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts, from the injury thereof: in like manner all Mineral acid Spirits, as of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol</hi> (except, as aforeſaid) <hi>Alom, Nitre, Salt, &amp;c.</hi> can (if kept in cloſe Veſſels) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves from damage by cold: ſo alſo <hi>Lixiviums</hi> made of the fixt Salts of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> or other Vegetables.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe Liquids, that are deſtitute of ſaline, ſulphurous, or other fermenting Particles, are of themſelves capable of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the ingreſs of cold Atoms, ſo as to ſuffer ſome <hi>Vacuolums</hi> to be fill'd, and other parts to be conſtring'd into a ſolid form of the congeal'd body of Ice, and all this by the medium of Air: which is the vehicle of theſe cold Atoms.</p>

                  <speaker>Pyroph.</speaker>
                  <p>I anſwer, That as the Air by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome congeneal Ferments (tacking to and fro therein) doth conſpire not only to the awakening the Ferments of Animals and Vegetables, and to the keeping them a foot, and that both in order to building of bodies, as well as to the pulling them down: ſo doth the Air at other ſeaſons contain other Particles of cold, which are able to ſuſpend the motion and action of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that is, if very intenſe, are able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Ferments of Men and other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, as is evident by the killing of many Men and Beaſts in cold Countreys, as in <hi>Ruſſia, Greenland,</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> the Froſts are ſometimes ſo ſtrong as that Men are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brought to Inns or Markets frozen on Horſe-back, are found rigid, and ſtarv'd to death, ſitting ſtreight up like Statues; And in Vegetables it's very diſcernable to have them mortified by ſtrong Froſts.</p>
                  <p>And as the cold Particles arreſt the vital

                  <p>Yea, in thawing Winds, all putrefactive Ferments grow vigorous, and are carried in great and numerous ſwarms through the common Vehicle, the Air, which either ſmite our Noſtrils very ſenſibly, or affect our Juyces indiſcernably to the producing great alterations therein: How much the froſt Particles penetrate any Fruits, ſo much do they when the Froſt breaks, undergo a putrefaction, as is obvious in Apples, and other Fruits, which the more they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to froſt Air, ſo much the ſooner they rot, and that becauſe the active Principles
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41852:70"/>are ſo far mortify'd (through the openneſs of their Pores) as to their natural and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine Fermentation, and ſo eaſily (upon the unhinging and unrivetting the cold Atoms,) fall into regreſſive and putrefactive Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

                  <p>Yes, how cold may be produc'd, we had an Experiment above 7 years ago, which was thus: Having mixed <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> and <hi>Saturn Ore</hi> upon a Marble, or in a Mortar, and put them into a ſubliming Urinal (for a peculiar purpoſe we then propos'd) to which adding Water, and ſhaking them together, while the ſolution was making produc'd an intenſe coldneſs to the hand holding the Glaſs, and waſhing the out-ſide of the Glaſs with water, found as it was pour'd on, immediately it became long fleaks of Ice, which as we took off and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more water on, did the ſame again and again: the ſame will <hi>Sal Armon.</hi> diſſolv'd <hi>per ſe</hi> in water do, alſo its <hi>caput mort.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining after the ſublimation thereof with <hi>Pot-aſh</hi> or <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> diſſolv'd in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>And to make two cold Liquors (cold to touch) to heat each other (to evince the reaſon of the contrary quality, <hi>viz.</hi> heat) we
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41852:71"/>have put Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> to water, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mixed by ſhaking, immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts a greater heat than can be ſuffered by the hand that holds the Glaſs; and from the ſame cauſe, one may eaſily cauſe Ice it ſelf to cauſe heat to another cold Liquor, by proceeding, as before, with Ice put in Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> as the worthy Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator, Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> tells us in his laſt Tract.</p>

                  <p>To which I anſwer <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> That as the Atoms of cold are brought to us through the Air by certain peculiar winds, which in their motion meeting with capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (<hi>viz.</hi> liquid watery) bodys, becomes coagulated therewith into that rigid body we call Ice; ſo there are other Atoms of heat which are brought at other ſeaſons, through the ſame Vehicle of Air, by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent (although to that purpoſe peculiar) winds, which in their motion, meeting with thoſe of cold, either in the Air, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated in watry bodies, reſolve, mortifie (I mean alter their texture) and dint them
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41852:71"/>ſo, as either altering their texture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they for a while ſwell, and flow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the water (whence upon thaws, Rivers for a time grow bigger) till they can extricate themſelves from the moiſt, and warm Particles, they are involv'd in; and by other winds are carryed into other places, to perform the ſame offices: or elſe do as ſome ſorts of Salts do to others of a different texture, <hi>viz.</hi> one to mortifie (to uſe a Chymical term) dint, and change another, until there reſult a <hi>neutrum,</hi> or third thing different from either of the two.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Beſides which, we are to conſider <hi>(Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droph.)</hi> that theſe mutually acting and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon each other, beget new ſhapes amongſt themſelves, and many times prove ſubtile penetrating Ferments, which being carryed in the belly of the wind, inſinuate into fermentative Liquors, and ſet them freſhly a working, which we ſee frequently happen in thawing winds, that both Ale and Beer often ferment anew, yea Wines too, eſpecially about the time of Vintage, when thoſe fermentative Particles are arreſted, and determin'd by vinous Atoms, which at that ſeaſon take wing, and float in the Air.</p>
               <p>The ſame alſo may cauſe ſtrange, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41852:72"/>fermentations in the blood, and other Juyces of our bodies, the efficient ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of Feavers, and other Endemical, yea Epidemical Diſeaſes: and that theſe winds and changes of Air thereby have an odd influence upon the fluid Juyces of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, is apparent, in that vulgar, yet true Proverb, that ſome carry Almanacks in their bones, can diſcern the changes of weather before hand, which as we apprehend can be from no other cauſe, than that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Particles of heat, cold or moiſture, or combinations thereof (carryed by different winds in the Vehicle of the Air, from whence all varieties of weather do cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly follow, which, I ſay, at firſt, or afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, muſtring in an inviſible manner in the Air) become Ferments, which rouſe up old Aches, Pains, Aſthma's, Heavineſs, weakneſs of the Joynts, and other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms vulgarly aſcribable to the <hi>Scurvey,</hi> and and that many times before the weather be diſcernably chang'd, becauſe theſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe indiſcernable alterations of weather, are prefigured, and tranſacted before hand in the Air.</p>
               <p>Whence many times (as may be obvious to a curious eye) proceed the ſudden and unexpected alterations of Symptoms in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed and craſie bodies, which ſo much
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41852:72"/>puzzle Phyſitians to know whence ſuch ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den changes, contrary to their expectation ſhould happen; how well do things ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, even according to their deſire, and ſometimes beyond their expectation at ſome peculiar juncture of time (attributed by Aſtrologers to I know not what configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Planets) and on the other hand, how croſs and thwarting to their hopes, things happen at other ſeaſons; and all this many times from various excited Ferments in the Air, which work differently upon bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, according to variety of conſtitutions, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Ferments, and modification of other parts.</p>
               <p>So alſo from other alterations in the Air, by ſome winds, a verminous ferment is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, as we ſee in the Spring time, when the winds breath long from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> that many <hi>Caterpillers,</hi> and other Inſects, are produc'd upon Trees, and Plants; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times putredinous animated Ferments are brought with winds from cadaverous bodies, which floating in the Air, prove ſeminaries to contagious and verminous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes; whence the great Plague at <hi>Milan,</hi> at which time, as <hi>Cardan</hi> reports, the Air was filled, yea the very duſt of the Earth animated with thoſe contagious Vermicles; ſo that in the Air often lurk ſecret Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41852:73"/>which may both produce different ſymptoms in the ſame diſeaſe, as alſo be the cauſe of many <hi>Epidemical</hi> Diſeaſes, whoſe Character (I mean of <hi>Exotick</hi> Ferments) may for ſome time be in the Air, before they ſettle upon Bodies, ſo as to cauſe a general diſcompoſure.</p>
               <p>And from the ſame cauſe, very probably it is, that Animals which are frequently abroad in the Air, have a foreſight or preſenſation of the alterations of Weather; (whence the ground of <hi>Auguration</hi> amongſt the Ancients) for their Bodies, being always expoſed to change of Air, in the variety of weather, become thereby in their Texture of parts, more capable of being affected, with the leaſt changes of Air, in which are always the forerunners of certain alterations of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the foreſaid congreſs of the minute Particles of Heat, Cold, Moiſture, and what elſe which give being (by different Winds from diverſe quarters) to changes of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Cranes</hi> are obſerved by ſome Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts, that when they fly ſoftly, and ſilently, do preſage fair weather; but when they haſten, make a great noiſe, and fly in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed order, do predict Storms; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Storks</hi> and <hi>Wild-Geeſe,</hi> as <hi>Wolfangius</hi> tells us in his <hi>Hiſtoria animalium Sacra;</hi> and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41852:73"/>therefore <hi>Storks</hi> and <hi>Cranes,</hi> before the coming of Winter, take wing and fly in Troops in a triangular form into hotter Countries, witneſs from <hi>Thracia</hi> into <hi>Egypt;</hi> and from <hi>Cilicia,</hi> into <hi>Perſia:</hi> [not to ſay what is reported, that when they fly near <hi>Mount Taurus,</hi> where ſtore of <hi>Eagles</hi> are, they each take a ſtone in their Bill to prevent any noiſe, leſt the <hi>Eagles</hi> ſhould ſeiſe upon them.]</p>

                  <p>WHat think you <hi>(Pyroph.)</hi> of the drying quality, which we define, <hi>qualitas patibilis, quae ſuo facile, alieno autem termino difficulter clauditur:</hi> Is not this competible to the Earth <hi>primarily,</hi> and to the Air <hi>ſecundarily,</hi> and to other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as they admit of the combination of this with other qualities, in the compoſition thereof.</p>

                  <speaker>Pyroph.</speaker>
                  <p>I think <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> and perhaps may make good, that what you call a drying quality, is no more a quality than its oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite moiſture; and that as moiſture is no qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <hi>primarily</hi> of the Air, nor <hi>ſecondarily</hi> of other Bodies in their Compoſition: ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is drineſs, as a quality, either peculiar to the Earth, or to Compound Bodies: For in that a Body is ſaid to be dry, is in as much as the parts which conſtitute it, are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Texture than liquid, and are ſo woven together, as to have few (at leaſt as diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) fluid parts.</p>
                  <p>And thoſe dry Bodies, are either naturally ſuch, as for inſtance, ſome ſorts of <hi>Stones,</hi> and ſome <hi>Calces</hi> of calcin'd Bodies, which by no force of Fire are ever reducible into
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41852:74"/>any liquid form: or elſe ſuch Bodies, as while kept from force of Fire, are accounted dry, of which are all <hi>Metals, Minerals, Metalline,</hi> and <hi>Mineral Ore,</hi> ſo me Stones, as <hi>Peables, Flints, Sand,</hi> Aſhes of burnt or calcin'd Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, all which by ſtreſs of Fire may be made to melt and become fluid, ſome <hi>per ſe,</hi> as the <hi>Metals</hi> and ſome <hi>Minerals,</hi> others by additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Salts, as ſome <hi>Minerals,</hi> alſo <hi>Mineral</hi> and <hi>Metalline Ore, Pebbles, Flint, Sand,</hi> &amp;c. by the addition of Salt of <hi>Kelp, Tartar,</hi> or other calcin'd Vegetables melt into tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Glaſs.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Calx</hi> of Metals fretted by Acids, and thereby reduc'd after Evaporation <hi>in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima</hi> (viz.) into their impapable <hi>Alcolizate</hi> pouders, are ſeemingly dry, yet theſe very ſubtile <hi>Crocus's</hi> of Metals; witneſs that of <hi>Copper,</hi> diſſolv'd into, and incorporated in that Body we call <hi>Verdigreece,</hi> by the help of the ſour Juice of <hi>Grapes,</hi> or in that which remains after the Vintage, if that be dry'd and beat to a moſt ſubtile pouder, (which by the motion of a Peſtle or the like, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the <hi>minuteneſs</hi> of its parts, fly up, and doth <hi>ferire nares</hi> as alſo that of natural <hi>Vitriol</hi>) do I ſay both by ſtreſs of Fire ariſe in a conſiderable white fume, and condenſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a plenty of liquid Spirits, as is evident in the Spirit of <hi>Verdigreeee,</hi> of <hi>Vitriol;</hi> and ſo
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41852:75"/>moſt of other Bodies, which being divided into their <hi>Minima,</hi> ſo as to appear in a dry Sapleſs form, may yet by diſtillation be turn'd moſtwhat into liquids, or by reduction into their <hi>Sulphurs</hi> or <hi>Mercuries</hi> (if <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lline</hi> Bodies) be furtherconvertible into the fluid Texture of parts.</p>
                  <p>VVherefore ſeeing dryneſs is no other than ſuch a Texture of parts in the conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Bodies, as renders the Concrete not eaſily fluid, nor apt to flow together, when the conſtitutive parts are rather <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuous</hi> than <hi>contiguous:</hi> therefore muſt this dry quality, as well as the reſt of the ſame fraternity, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> forfeit its ſuppoſed Eſſence of a quality, and loſe its repute of a nothing, for ſo I eſteem it, or little better, while under the notion of a quality.</p>
                  <p>Hence thoſe degrees of qualities, which <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> you in your Philoſophy) and <hi>Medicks</hi> are apt to aſcribe Concretes to, are no more to be taken notice of, than the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities themſelves: ſo that all your Solutions of apparences by your ſuppoſed degrees of the <hi>Primary</hi> qualities, will (what is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing premis'd) of their own accord fall to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

                  <p>As to which query <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> concerning the ſecond qualities, I anſwer, that as the firſt qualities, are not in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> as ſuch, ſo neither are the ſecond, for <hi>ſublata cauſa tollitur effectus:</hi> But the firſt are the ſuppoſed cauſe of the ſecond, which being (by reaſons aforeſaid) deducted out of the Catalogue of <hi>Entities,</hi> nothing of the ſecond qualities, as ſuch can remain.</p>

                  <speaker>Hydroph.</speaker>
                  <p>Is not rarity a ſecond quality, ariſing chiefly from Heat, having its parts extenuated, as <hi>Herbs, Pruinae, Clouds?</hi> And is not <hi>Denſity</hi> another from Cold, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its parts bound up, and ſolidly adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to each other, as <hi>Glaſs, Stone, Iron,</hi> and the reſt of the Metals? And further is not <hi>Levity</hi> a quality ariſing from Heat, making things capable of moving upwards; and <hi>Gravity</hi> a quality from Cold, which makes things move downwards towards a Center?</p>

                  <speaker>Pyroph.</speaker>
                  <p>I anſwer <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> that in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41852:76"/>what you term <hi>Rarity,</hi> I ſee no neceſſity of giving the name of a ſecond quality ariſing from the <hi>Primary</hi> Heat; but that it is only ſuch a Texture of parts in the compoſition of ſome Bodies, as makes them appear thin, and as it were finely woven; being a rare Texture of parts, with many <hi>Streiners, Poroſities,</hi> or <hi>vacuolums</hi> interſpers'd, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to whoſe Fabrick of parts, our Senſes are generally affected, ſo as they fall under ſuch and ſuch diſtinct perception thereof.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Thus Air is a rare Body, in as much as its parts are of a fine, thin, <hi>tenuious</hi> plyable Texture as aforeſaid: And as <hi>Rarity,</hi> ſo <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> is no quality, being no other than ſuch a Body, whoſe parts are cloſely ſet together, with few <hi>Poroſities,</hi> thus <hi>Stone, Glaſs, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alline,</hi> and <hi>Mineral</hi>-Bodies, are ſuch whoſe conſtitutive parts are cloſely bound up, and faſt rivetted together; and therefore no need of aſcribing its original to cold.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Levity,</hi> it is peculiar to ſuch Bodies whoſe Texture is rare and finely woven, and ſo the ſequel of that we call <hi>Rarity.</hi> Alſo <hi>Gravity</hi> is the contrary, being the neceſſary product of ſuch Bodies, whoſe parts are cloſely put together, I mean of thoſe which are compact and denſe Bodies.</p>
               <p>And as to the reſt, of ſecond qualities, as Hardneſs, Softneſs, Thickneſs, Thinneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:41852:77"/>all which I ſay, are but different <hi>Modificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the parts of Bodies, whereby they variouſly affect our Senſes, having the ſame way of ſolution as thoſe I have already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, therefore ſhall forbear.</p>
               <p>Now that theſe <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> are neither the <hi>Indexes</hi> nor the <hi>Products</hi> of the <hi>Quater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> of firſt qualities, and conſequently not to be reckoned (as ſuch) in the <hi>Category</hi> of qualities, is evident, in that one and the ſame Body, by a <hi>Metaſtaſis</hi> of its parts by Fire, Salts, or <hi>Solvents,</hi> may undergo all or moſt of thoſe you call <hi>ſecond</hi> and perhaps <hi>firſt</hi> qualities too: ſo that to which of theſe, the Eſſence of that Body ſhould be attributed, would prove a <hi>query</hi> too difficult for moſt of your Philoſophy grounded upon theſe qualities, to reſolve.</p>
               <p>Thus for inſtance, ſuppoſe we take <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> into our conſideration, which in its <hi>Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This glaſs prepared as aforeſaid, will by further addition of Fire and Salts, become <hi>Metalline,</hi> melt and run into a <hi>Regulus,</hi> which melts and flows like <hi>Lead</hi> or <hi>Quick-ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> (call'd by <hi>Chymiſts</hi> the coagulated <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> of <hi>Antimony</hi>) is denſe, hard, heavy, and <hi>opacous,</hi> which again may be ſublim'd into Flowers, out of which Flowers may a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Mercury</hi> begot by boyling with Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> &amp;c. as is mention'd in Volum. 4. <hi>Theat.

               <p>Alſo <hi>Antimony</hi> by addition of Salts with the help of Fire, produceth that Maſs we call <hi>hepar Antimonii,</hi> (which makes the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently us'd <hi>Emetick</hi> Wine) upon which diſſolv'd in Water, if diſtill'd <hi>Vinegar</hi> be poured, it makes a ſpeedy ſeparation of a Red and Yellow <hi>Sulphur,</hi> with a <hi>Fetid Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous</hi>

               <p>In like manner, <hi>Antimony</hi> calcin'd with <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> either becomes white, or by another addition thereto, with a ſlight <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice</hi> is turn'd into a green <hi>Sulphur</hi> which flames, and has all the properties of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Brimſtone:</hi> So <hi>Antimony</hi> with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Mercury ſublimate,</hi> is by the help of the Salts therein contain'd, brought into a <hi>gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> Oyl, which as it becomes a fluid Body by the leaſt Heat, ſo it is congeal'd into <hi>Cryſtals</hi> frequently by Cold: if upon this <hi>Oyl,</hi> warm Water, or <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> be poured, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitates into a ſoft powder, call'd <hi>Mercurius Vitae:</hi> if Spirit of <hi>Nitre</hi> or <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> be diſtill'd therefrom, it becomes (after the paſſing away of a ſtifling <hi>Sulphureous Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi> Fume) another ſoft, white, impalpable powder, call'd <hi>Bezoadicum Minerale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> how the ſame Body of <hi>Antimony,</hi> is by the various applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41852:78"/>of Fire, and Salts, ſo altered in the Texture of its parts, as to give that varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of apparences under which it arrives dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently diſguis'd to our Senſes, <hi>viz.</hi> as that which appears denſe, heavy, hard, of one colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall preſently diſcover it ſelf to be rare, light, ſoft, of another colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and which even now appear'd ſolid, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, ſhall forthwith become ſoft, and fluid; where it will be difficult to judge truly of the nature of this <hi>Mineral</hi> Concrete by the preſent prevalency of any of theſe <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary</hi> qualities.</p>
               <p>Yea and further to acquaint you, what great alterations and changes may be made in the ſame Body, by the tranſpoſition and ſometimes <hi>volatization</hi> of the parts, through the mediation of Fire and <hi>Solvents,</hi> I know by a certain method, how to make <hi>Antimony</hi> (the Body we urge for inſtance) as ſolid a Concrete as it is, ariſe over the Helm in an eaſie Heat, and in the form of a Liquor, and by which ſometimes I have known it come into the Helm, even in the gentle heat of <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> in the form not only of a limpid liquor, but alſo ſometimes of a Salt diſſolvable <hi>per deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium</hi> into an Oyl, eaſily diſcernable by its lacteſcence and precipitation by the bare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſimple water.</p>

               <p>I might <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> confirm this by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtances of the like nature, <hi>viz.</hi> by ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the various <hi>Phaenomena</hi>'s of <hi>Vitriol, Copper</hi> and other Metals, whoſe different tranſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of parts by Fire, Salts, and Solvents, make up the great variety of thoſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſequels of Bodies, which you term Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whether <hi>primary</hi> or <hi>ſecondary;</hi> and yet are really no other, than the different mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the conſtitutive parts of Bodies, out of one Poſture, and Figure into another: whereby the ſame Body differently ſmites our ſenſes with thoſe mechanical Affections of matter, which <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> you aſcribe to the firſt and ſecond qualities: For the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illuſtrating of which, you may conſult the works of that worthy and incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Philoſopher and induſtrious ſearcher of Nature, the Honourable <hi>Boyle,</hi> eſpecially his Treatiſe of the <hi>Origin of Forms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before we conclude this Section, give me leave <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> to acquaint you, that amongſt other Inſtances, we have and might urge, how that from Metals by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Salts, and help of Fire, may reſult other ſorts of concretions than uſually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, by different modifications mask'd with various qualifications: So that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral-gums (if I may ſo call them) may hence be made, which are much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

                  <speaker>Pyroph.</speaker>
                  <p>Thoſe you reckon <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> are no more to be accounted Qualities, than the reſt beforenamed: But are to be look'd upon as different affections of Concrete Bodies, as they ſtand in a relation to a perception by our ſenſes; and firſt as to the definition of colour, whoſe <hi>genus</hi> is <hi>extremitas,</hi> methinks <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> began at the wrong end; For it is not the extremity of a Diaphanous Body which gives Eſſence to colour, being only neceſſary thereto <hi>à Poſteriori:</hi> For if I miſtake not, light ſhould be the <hi>genus</hi> of the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of colour which admitting of various refractions and reflections, in, and from the extremities or ſurfaces of Bodies, make thoſe
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41852:80"/>different apparences thereof we call co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it ſhould ſeem to me, that what you call <hi>extremitas perſpicui,</hi> is not of that extent as to compriſe the generality of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, although we ſhould admit of it as the <hi>genus;</hi> and that becauſe we ſee colours as frequently made, by ſimple reflections of light from the ſurfaces of bodies, witneſs from all Vegetables, Animals, ſtain'd or dy'd Garments and the reſt, as well (I ſay) as by refractions of the ſame light (the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of all colours) in perſpicuous bodies: For that colour ſhould be confin'd to the only extremity of a <hi>diaphanous</hi> body, is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks too ſtrait every way, both as to the <hi>genus,</hi> as alſo to the ſpecifical difference of the true definition of colour; in as much as where a <hi>diaphanous</hi> body proves opake, the luminous Rayes which before were refracted, do now become terminated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, and yet doth no leſs produce variety of colours than before.</p>
                  <p>As for inſtance, Suppoſe a Solution of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol</hi> made in diſtill'd Water, which is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous body, giving a green colour, and that as well by refraction as tranſmſſiion of Rays from a luminous body, gliding ſide-ways, and ſmiting through the Liquor, which renders it <hi>diaphanous;</hi> whoſe tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41852:81"/>of parts with the interſtices in the fluid <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> cauſeth (I ſay) ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction of light, as thereby repreſents it under the form of a green colour. If into this green diaphanous Liquor <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> you pour a clear ſolution of Galls, the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the vitriolin parts in the water will become ſo altered, as that in lieu of a <hi>dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous,</hi> it will become an opake Liquor; ſo that the luminous Rays which before were refracted and tranſmitted, will now become either reflected or ſo intangled in the texture of the parts, as neither to make a tranſmiſſion, refraction, or any conſiderable reflection of light there-from, and therefore becomes opacous or black.</p>
                  <p>For by the addition of Galls to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Liquor, the firſt body, whoſe parts were uniform and regularly tranſmitted and refracted, the Rays of light, doth now by this commixture with the Particles of Galls, muſter in ſo confus'd a poſture, make an extraverſion of large flats, ſome of which always fall in the rear of the Angles, and junctures of others; ſo as the tranſmiſſion of light is quite intercepted, and therefore what reflection is made, is only ſo much as to be ſufficient to make that repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of bodies by that colour we call black.</p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:41852:81"/>
                  <p>Which that it is ſo, appears further by pouring Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> Spirit of <hi>Nitre, Aqua-fortis,</hi> or the like corroſive Acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits upon thoſe vitriolin opacous Liquors, or other bodies made black by vitriolin aſtringent Steins; where you will preſently view thoſe Particles of the Gall, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fill'd the Pores of the Liquor, and by extraverting many flats made the Liquor opacous, dark, and inky, will now become fretted, diſſolv'd, and the flats leſſened, ſo as the parts will again return into their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer uniform poſture, and ſuffer the light (by becoming clear) to be tranſmitted as before, ſo to become a diaphanous Liquor, as at firſt: as you may further ſee in our Experiments about the change of Colours in Spaw Water, in our <hi>Hydrolog. Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that colours are nothing elſe but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent refractions and repercuſſions of light from bodies, according to various Angles of incidence and reflection from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent texture of the depth or ſuperficies thereof, carryed through the tranſparent Tunicles and Humours of the Eyes, as through ſo many Glaſſes (for from the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Fabric of the Eye are artificial optical or microſcopical Glaſſes contriv'd) vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after a various manner the Optic
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41852:82"/>Nerves, ſo as to make that kind of ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we call Viſion: That colours are, I ſay, nothing elſe but ſuch I might confirm by many more inſtances <hi>(viz.)</hi> by the frequent Manuals of <hi>Dyers, Tanners, Painters, &amp;c.</hi> in their colouring <hi>Garments, Leather, Wood, &amp;c.</hi> by actual bodies (not qualities) of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, Alum, Argol, Indico, Madder, Lime, Oak Bark, Minium, Ceruſs, Verdigreece, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh-white, Gum, Vernice, ultra-Marine, &amp;c.</hi> all which produce different colours, not from inherent qualities in thoſe bodies, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from a legitimate contemperature of the four Elements, but repreſent themſelves as being actual bodies; I mean, ſhew that great variety of colours by the different texture of their conſtitutive parts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by light becomes ſo differently refracted or reflected, as to be ſufficient to cauſe that great variety of colours, we ſee amongſt bodies: where we might from the aforeſaid different reflections and refractions of light ſhew amongſt the cauſes of thoſe apparences we call colours, what for inſtance white is, and how made, which we ſuppoſe to be no other than that texture of parts which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from many ſuperficies, flat, or ſpheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal born up at ſome little diſtances from each other, by one or more of theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſes: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. By Air; 2. Atoms of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41852:82"/>Cold; 3. Other ſimiliar inter-woven bodies; 4. Or laſtly, are wrought into ſuch a texture of parts by the preparatory Veſſels. Firſt by Air, as is evident in Torrents, great falls, and other agitations of Waters, in the white froth of Ale, Beer, or other fermenting Liquors, alſo in the warming of Ale or Beer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where the Particles of Water and fermentative Liquors are huft up with thoſe of Air, being thereby reduc'd into globular Bubbles, the aggregation of which give us that Phaenomenon of white obſervable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: the like may be reckoned upon in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of white Oyntments from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of Oyls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, or by Atoms of cold, as is evident in the obvious Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon of Snow: where, from the cold Atoms woven in, with, and between the flats (for ſuch are the figure of its parts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this diſguiſe) of watery Particles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults that colour of white, as alſo other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parences compitible to water under the Maſque of Snow. Thirdly, Or by other inter-weaving bodies, as is evident where the texture of bodies are ſuch as are made up of many ſuperficies each upon other, by a natural <hi>ſtratum ſuper ſtratum,</hi> born up by ſome other interpoſing parts, as is evident in natural Concretions, <hi>viz. Talk, Alabaſter, Bones, Horns, Plumes, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:41852:83"/>In factitious, <hi>viz. Luna Cornea, Venice-glaſs</hi> pulveriz'd <hi>Ceruſs, Paper, &amp;c.</hi> In all which the light from the aforeſaid texture of parts is ſo refracted and reflected as to exhibit us that apparence of white in all ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Or laſtly, are wrought into ſuch a texture of parts by preparatory Veſſels, by which in Animals, I mean the Lacteals, and Glandules, whence the whiteneſs of Milk, and by other Analogous in Vegetables, whence the milky Juyces of all ſorts of Spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>Carduus Marie, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to demonſtrate further, that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour (and in particular White) is no other than the reſult of ſuch a peculiar texture of bodies, as reflects the light after ſuch a mode competible to that apparence: and that the ſame body undergoing no other change of any additional, but barely a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition of the parts of the active Principles therein contained, was ſpontaneouſly redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to its priſtine clarity and tranſparency, I had this following <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to me in an Experiment I was then trying; In which Experiment, I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to name one of the conſtituent Liquors, in as much as in the main it relates not to this place, and only reckon upon the (to our purpoſe) pertinent <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> which was this; I having two tranſparent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41852:83"/>by me, one was rectified Spirit of Wine, the other a Mineral Liquor, upon the mixing theſe, I had (beſides the gentle heat caus'd from a moderate fermentation of the Principles) forthwith the apparence of a Milk-white Liquor, through the whole body of the mixture, which (and what was very curious and remarkable to behold) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a very few minutes without any extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic addition, was ſpontaneouſly reduc'd to a tranſparent Liquor, as limpid almoſt as either of the Liquors was before mixture: and all this (which yet adds to admiration) without the leaſt precipitation, or any ſort of ſediment what ever.</p>
                  <p>I might further inlarge <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> but that I pretend not here to give a Body of Philoſophy, therefore ſhall deſignedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</p>

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41852:84"/>while it is in thoſe bodies we call it <hi>lux,</hi> but when it is diſpers'd in a perſpicuous body, as the Air, then it is properly <hi>lumen;</hi> and that in Fire the <hi>lux,</hi> or quality thereof ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth that we call <hi>lumen,</hi> which illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates the body of Air, and thereby makes it perſpicuous.</p>

                  <speaker>Pyroph.</speaker>
                  <p>To which <hi>Hydroph.</hi> I anſwer, That your definition of <hi>lumen</hi> to be the act of a perſpicuous body as it is perſpicuous, and your diſtinction of <hi>lux</hi> and <hi>lumen,</hi> are all too ſhort (in my apprehenſion) of the offence of a lucid or luminous body, and that becauſe what you call <hi>actus perſpicui</hi> (as you define <hi>lumen</hi>) is no more according to your own Hypotheſis than a product of a quality, or a quality of a quality: For it is (you ſay) produc'd from that you call <hi>lux,</hi> and this, you ſay, is a quality of a lucid body; ſo that <hi>lumen</hi> muſt be the product of <hi>lux,</hi> a quality of its quality, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence one quality muſt be the ſubject of another, and why not of a third, <hi>viz.</hi> ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and ſo a fourth, and ſo <hi>ad infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay further, to ſuppoſe light to be a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a lucid body, as it abides and is fixt in that body, and yet that this ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that you call <hi>lumen</hi> in another body, which it has or can have no eſſential depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41852:84"/>upon, is to admit of qualities with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the predicate of a ſubject, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your own Doctrine is abſurd enough.</p>

                  <p>But what think you <hi>(Pyroph.)</hi> of the <hi>genus</hi> of light, is it a ſubſtance or body, or is it not rather a quality, or <hi>quid incorporeum?</hi> That it is not a corporeal ſubſtance, we have ſeveral Arguments to urge; as firſt, If it were a body, it could not ſo ſuddenly be diffus'd through the whole Hemiſphere, and that by reaſon of reſiſtence of the <hi>medium.</hi> Next to that it would ſuppoſe a penetration of bodies, and that becauſe there is no part of a perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body, as of Water, and Air, but is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated thereby.

As to the firſt therefore we ſay, that it is not ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to apprehend that an eſſential luminous body (ſuch I mean whoſe light ſprings from the evibrations of the inteſtine Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation (of its kind) of its intrinſic Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that is, whoſe light is from it ſelf and not from another) ſhould upon its exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41852:85"/>motion, immediately reach to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphery of its Orbs activity, then that it ſhould perform that work of illumination by an imaginary quality of a quality, by a <hi>lumen,</hi> which has its being from a quality of a lucid body. As to the reſiſtency of ſuch mediums (the conſtitution of whoſe parts by its teniouſneſs and facil receſs, render them diaphanous upon the acceſs of the Rays of light) is no more an obſtacle to the ſpeedy diffuſion of the body of light, than the Air doth reſiſt the exploſive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gun-powder, or than the Air doth oppoſe the activity of Fire within its own Orb.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> we might better (and I think more agreeable to its nature) define Light to be a quick Evibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or extenſive and (of its kind) fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative motion of the intrinſic Principles of lucid bodies, ſtretching its nimble corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Rays from its ſelf as the center to the periphery of its Orbs activity: a quick Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration, and extenſive Motion, I ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that adds to the quickneſs of its tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion through a proper medium: For we ſee that one ſpark of Fire, or fired matter, mov'd ſuddenly in a round, makes an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition of a whole circle of Fire, which ſuppoſe it were a <hi>Radius,</hi> or a Ray of Fire
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41852:85"/>whirl'd ſuddenly about its own center, would immediately appear as a whole ſphere of Fire, and that meerly from the quickneſs of its motion, which ſeemingly makes Fire or Light appear much more than really it is.</p>
                  <p>So that we can no ſooner conſider a lucid body in motion, that is, its Principles or parts in an inteſtine colliſion or fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive extruſion, but at the ſame inſtant we muſt apprehend it extended, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion is terminated by the utmoſt circle of its activity: in ſo much as ſuppoſing a luminous body mov'd, and extended, as aforeſaid, is it ſelf but the center to the whole Orb of its light, whoſe Rays pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, in their extenſive motion are globu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar bodies, whirl'd about their own <hi>Axis,</hi> which very Orb may not improperly be call'd the Luminary: unleſs we take in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notion of the co-exiſtency of firy Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles: (<hi>liquidi ſimul ignis,</hi> the liquid Fire, as <hi>Virgil</hi> ſpeaks, in his <hi>Eglog.</hi> to <hi>Sileno</hi>) inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd in the depth of the great Sphere, which becomes enkindled, and takes flame upon the acceſs of the Rays of the great Luminary, the Sun.</p>
                  <p>Whether way we pleaſe to take it, amounts to the ſame thing: For whether we conſider, ſuppoſe the Sun as the great
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41852:86"/>Luminary in Motion, extending its Rays inſtantaneouſly to the greateſt circle of its lucid Orb reaching from it ſelf round to the ſuppoſed <hi>Vortices</hi> of the otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd fixt Stars, and illuminates the whole Orb ſave the ſhades of the opake bodies, the Earth, Moon, and other Planets, which in their motion about it have always ſome parts ſhaded (which is that we call Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) which, I ſay, whether we conſider the ſolar Luminary, that great fountain and treaſure of light, mov'd, extended, and thereby filling its whole Orb (the ſhades excepted) even to the periphery thereof, with corporeal Rays through the whole medium of the vaſt <hi>Expanſum,</hi> is the ſame as to apprehend a liquid Fire, or firy Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple interſpers'd in the whole depth of the Fabric of the World, which upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of its Compeer, the Rays of light immediately darted from the Sun, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reflected from other bodies, joyns iſſue therewith, takes Flame, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the agil Motion of their parts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one great luminous Orb.</p>
                  <p>So that motion, and conſequently exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is proper to both, making (either way) light to diffuſe it ſelf ſpeedily through our Hemiſphere: For whether it be darted immediately from the Luminary, and ſo fill
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41852:86"/>up the whole Orb of light, or it meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with congeneal firy or ſulphureous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles floating in the great deep, giving flame to one part after another, till the whole become illuminated, may be conceiv'd readily performable by motion: For a few firy Particles put into a vibrating agil <hi>Flour,</hi> or into a rapid colliſion makes a great light, and ſpreads far in a medium, whoſe texture of parts makes no interruption in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion thereof.</p>
                  <p>To aſſign a preciſe figure to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles of light, is too curious, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps hazardous of incurring a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For to ſay with the <hi>Democritans</hi> that firy Atoms are of a pyramid form, implies me-thinks a tacit contradiction both in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks,</hi> as well as in Phyſicks; For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Doctrine, Atoms) even as the word it ſelf) implies indiviſibility; which that theſe minute Particles ſhould be indiviſible, and yet Pyramid-wiſe is to me very ſtrange, for being they are bodies, and theſe bodies Pyramids, muſt of neceſſity be ſolid Pyramids: now that ſuch which are always made up of Lines, Superficies, and Profundities (the natural ſequels of Solids) ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Theſe being premiſed, you ſee <hi>(Hydaoph.)</hi> it proves not difficult to aſſign the cauſe, why the Rays of Light though corporeal, ſhould ſo readily and inſtantaneouſly be tranſmitted through the Hemiſphere, or rather through the whole Sphere, (excepting as aforeſaid the ſhades of the Earth and other Planets) as to make that Light we ſee in the World, notwithſtanding the immenſneſs of the vaſt <hi>medium</hi> it wades through, the <hi>radius</hi> of which Circle, is both in relation to its ſelf as alſo to its Circle, incommenſurable whoſe motion is always in right lines, unleſs inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the interpoſitions of opake Bodies.</p>

                  <p>Your next Argument <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> of the Penetration of Bodies upon the ſuppoſition of the corporealneſs of Light, grounded upon the general perſpicuity of illuminated Bodies, will not be uneaſy to refute, and that becauſe the bodys of perſpicuous mediums are therefore diaphanous, in that they are tenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, &amp; pliable and thereby eaſily, and readily give way to the tranſmiſſion of the nimble corporeal Rays of Light, which upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count pervade the tenuious Texture of ſuch mediums even <hi>ictu oculi;</hi> and yet theſe Rays if compared with other minute Bodies floating in the Atmoſphere, are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo numerous, as we are apt commonly to apprehend: For although to our eye plac'd in any point of the diaphanous medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, upon the extenſion of the Body of Light we ſee the Air totally illuminated, as if it were nothing elſe but Light, yet if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the largeneſs of the Texture of our Eye, and the proportionableneſs of an object to render it capable of affecting thereof, we ſhall find that it will require the muſtering of a great many of minute Bodies, to make up the leaſt ſenſible Object: ſo that the Texture of the eye is ſo fram'd by glaſſy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, as to concenter the largely dilated Rays of Light, That thereby it may become ſerviceable to the tranſmiſſion of <hi>Species.</hi>

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41852:88"/>the natural frame of the Eye.</p>
                  <p>So that it is by theſe Glaſſes (that I may ſo call them) of the Eye, that the diſtant Rays of Light become concentred, to make a ſenſible impreſſion there; whereby the Air ſeems to us to be ſo totally diaphanous, as if there was nothing elſe but Light, when indeed it needs a Collection of its Rays by ſo skilful a contrivance as the Fabrick of the Organ of the Eye, to make it ſenſible.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore it is very apparent, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the corporealneſs of the Rays of Light, there is no neceſſity of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the penetration of Bodies both becauſe of the diſtance of the Rays of Light, as alſo of the tenuiouſneſs and pliable fluid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the medium.</p>

                  <p>For the radius of the Sun-beams extend far beyond the ſhaded, and therefore dark
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41852:89"/>cones of the Earth, and other Planetary Bodies: ſo that in the ſhade there is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe Light is intercepted by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pake Body; but beyond the ſhaded cone, the Rays become further continued, even to the very circumference of its vaſt lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Orb: and ſo the like of any other lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Body: for if a Candle be plac'd at a competent diſtance from a Globe in a large Room; ſo far as the Conical ſhade of the Globe reacheth, ſo far it is dark, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that, the Rays are again continued even to the extent of its Orb's activity, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing interrupt.</p>
                  <p>And now <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> having overturn'd your Arguments againſt, let me give you one (for all) for the corporealneſs of Light: and that is thus <hi>(viz.)</hi> that which may be mov'd, percuſs'd, or reflected, is a Body; But ſuch is Light, <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Major is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, both becauſe qualities cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go a <hi>loco</hi>-motion, but as conſidered in their <hi>ſubjectum inh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I think <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> that Sapour is no quality of a mixt Body, ariſing from any contemperature thereof, but conſiſts only in a relation betwixt our food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and our Palat; is that whereby our aliment becomes ſapid as I may ſay, and indicates a conſonance or diſſonance betwixt Concretes, and our guſt or Palat; doth not conſiſt as the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts will have it ſolely in the Saline Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of things, although I muſt confeſs it much-what depends thereon: But it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the predominancy of the Saline or from a commixture of that with the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous parts of the Concrete, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make up that we call Sapour in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes: for one or both theſe upon chewing being diſſolv'd (at leaſt ſome portion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) in the <hi>Saliva,</hi> preſently thereby inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates into the pores of the Tongue and Palat, and ſo affects that Senſe we call Taſte, and this by the different Textures and combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Salt, and Sulphur, in all palatable or ſaporous Bodies.</p>

                  <p>And as bitter, ſweet, aſtringent, ſtiptick, auſtere, ſo probably all other remarkable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are producible by Art, imitating Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; in as much as both have the ſame Principles, only variouſly modified, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon: the ſame Principles being ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to both, that what Art goeth upon the ſame nature <hi>ſuo modo</hi> probably uſeth in the productions of Bodies and their qualities Phyſically.</p>
                  <p>In all which aforeſaid experimental ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations we ſee the ſame (or analogous) acidity being determined upon diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Bodies, give various <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of taſtes, according to the difference of the Sulphur inclos'd in divers Bodies it meets with: and whereas we have no better way of taking meaſures of Natures workings in Bodies from her own intimate and Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Principles, than by Mechanicks, or arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial imitations thereof: Therefore by how much the nearer we approach by skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful contrivances to emulate Nature in the production of new Bodies and qualifications or properties thence reſulting, the more

                  <p>For as ſweetneſs (for inſtance) is made from ſome Acids hitting upon and concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring with inſipid Bodies, in whoſe Texture a peculiar Sulphur lodgeth, (as in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples aforeſaid) ſo likewiſe probably Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uſeth an acid and a peculiar Sulphur (both native and ſeminal) as the mechanical Agents in the Phyſical production of the <hi>Saccharin</hi> juice of <hi>Sugar-canes:</hi> that Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Sugar (as well as metalline) has its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate acidity, is evident, from the ſeparation of an acid liquor in the diſtillation of Sugar, as well as an acid ſpirit is by the ſame way ſeparable from <hi>Metallin</hi> or <hi>Saturnin</hi> Sugar; which very <hi>acidum</hi> as well as that of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar or <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> will with the inſipid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Lead</hi> or <hi>Minium,</hi> gain a freſh ſugarneſs or ſaccharin ſweetneſs: and that it contains a Sulphur, is evident, both from the <hi>coruſcation</hi> of Sugar (I mean Loaf, or hard) beat in a Mortar, which ſtrikes fire at every knock of the Peſtil: as alſo from the Oyl diſtillable with the acid Spirit. And what we have ſaid of the Vegetable and Metalline Sugars, Art imitating Nature in order to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that property we call ſweet, the ſame analogically may poſſibly, <hi>conſideratis conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randis,</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:41852:93"/>be ſaid of all the reſt of thoſe other properties or relative qualities we call Taſtes.</p>
                  <p>But to ſay what combinations of Saline and Sulphureous parts in the various Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Bodies, and what proportions and adaptations thereof will be requiſite for the making ſeveral ſorts of Sapors, to rank them in their ſeveral Claſſes from thoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar contrivances of matter, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Fabrick of Bodies, as they ſtand related to that Senſe, is a work now <hi>Hydroph.</hi> too tedious to inſiſt upon: For it would require a diligent ſcrutiny into the different figuration of Salts, and that not ſingly into the forms the variety of Salts naturally ſhoot into, but as thoſe ſtand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with Sulphureous parts, and thoſe again involv'd in the Texture of other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining Particles, which much alter their former ſolitary figures, and thereby produce varieties of Sapors: concerning which we ſhall touch in our <hi>Halolog. Chym.</hi> Nor ſhall we here further diſcourſe of thoſe morbid diſaffections or prepoſterous prevarications of this Senſe by the irregularities of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans thereof from thoſe alterations of the Juices and Solids of our Bodies, which we call Diſeaſes: but ſhall leave them to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſpection.</p>

                  <p>SEeing we have diſcours'd of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, laſtly what think you <hi>(Pyroph.)</hi> of Odours? Is not Odour a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a mixt Body, ariſing from a dry Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidneſs contempered with a moiſture, brought forth by Heat?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pyroph.</speaker>
                  <p>That Odour ſhould be a Quality, <hi>(Hydroph.)</hi> I as much deny as I have done Sapour, neither do I ſee any grounds, why it ſhould be ſuppos'd to ariſe from any dry ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidneſs, or any contemperature thereof, with a proper moiſture from Heat: For firſt having (and I think evidently enough) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated the <hi>non</hi> exiſtency of Concretes from the <hi>quaternary</hi> of Elements; it will therefore naturally follow, that <hi>ſecondary</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Bodies, in order to their relation to our Sences, are to be ſolv'd by ſome other more rational Hypotheſis, and that is by aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing it to an extenſion of ſome nimble, agil parts, carried off by an inſenſible colliſion of the intrinſick Principles of Bodies; where the parts are from the inteſtine Fermentation ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliz'd, &amp; highly volariz'd, which bears much upon the Energy of the Sulphur, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Texture of whoſe <hi>apporrhea</hi>'s (chiefly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emerging
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41852:94"/>from their dilated operative Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs) do variouſly <hi>ferire nares</hi> ſmite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently upon that Organ of Sence, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that great variety of Odours, we find Iſſuing from Concrete Bodies.</p>
                  <p>That Odours chiefly depend upon the Volatization, and Fermentative extenſion of Sulphurs, is moſt-what apparent in Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, where we ſee thoſe are moſt <hi>Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,</hi> which are moſt pregnant with Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous Emanations, and whoſe Sulphurs are moſt ſubtile, and extenſive, (from their intrinſick Fermentation) always upon the wing: For we ſee that odorous Vegetables are moſt fragrant at their time of flowering and ſeeding, during which ſeaſon the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs or Oyls are moſt predominant, as being uppermoſt in the wheele of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo breath forth the <hi>effluvia</hi> to the utmoſt circle of their Orbs activity: which as I ſaid are not Qualities, but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Particles of extenſive active Bodies, ſet on work by the ſpringy Ferments connatural to their ſeminal Principles, and wound off in the form of ſubtile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible <hi>Apporhea;</hi> whence probably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the great variety of Vegetable O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,</p>
                  <p>Alſo in Animals, the Odours of all their Excrements as Dung, Urine, Sweat, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purated
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41852:94"/>matter of Ulcers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proceed from various Sulphurs excited by different Ferments in the <hi>Analyſis</hi> of Concretes in their Road to nouriſhment. So alſo moſt <hi>faetid</hi> Odours ariſe from the Sulphurs of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tredinous and cadaverous Bodies, where they are taken in pieces by putrid analytical Ferments.</p>
                  <p>And as the objects, ſo the Organs of this ſenſe, is next to be conſidered, concerning which we we ſhall in ſhort ſay, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Texture thereof, is capable of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering to us the cauſes of divers, and thoſe abſtruce <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> whence we ſay, that there are ſome ſubtile <hi>effluvia</hi> which exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from Bodies, as the reſult from the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of Animal Juices, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become the Object of ſome curiouſly wrought Organs of Senſe, how ever acute, yet are ſufficient to ſmite the delicately wrought Organs of other Animals, is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent amongſt other Creatures chiefly in Doggs, who excel in the curioſity of ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling beyond all compariſon, who can by the great ſagacity of their Organs, or from ſuch a Texture thereof as is ſuſceptible of the moſt minute impreſſions of the leaſt <hi>Effluvia,</hi> who can I ſay by their bare ſmel diſcerne their maſter, among thouſands and how they will trace their ſteps throughout a
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41852:95"/>whole Country, and finde their own way home at a vaſt diſtance, by the ſame facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or acurateneſs of Organs.</p>
                  <p>Yea, that even the Organs of our Senſes are in ſome perſons (through an <hi>idioſyncriſia</hi>) capable of arriving at a higher pitch of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, than is vulgarly obſerved, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ordinary proportion of Men, may (amongſt other examples) be evinced by that ſtrange relation, which <hi>Joannes Leo</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> and quoted by learned <hi>Cafaubon,</hi> of a blinde man that was a Guide to certain Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants travelling through the deſerts of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia: Caſaub.</hi> p. 23. The man Rode upon a Camel, led his Company not by his eyes (for he had none) but by his ſmel, which was ſo exquiſite, that having been acquainted with thoſe ways before, he could find by the ſent of the very Earth, nay of the Sand, (which was reached to him at every mile) where he was, and deſcribe the places unto them as they went along, yea told them long before (which prov'd true though not believed then) when they drew near to inhabited pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>Now how Bodies ſhould by their exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Sulphurs or intrinſick Ferments, ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently affect the ſenſative Organ, as to produce all thoſe various impreſſions upon our Senſe, which we call Odours or ſmels,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41852:95"/>and thoſe in ſo different a manner as we (for want of a method of deſcribing them) know not whether we have all the ſame impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſmels from the ſame Concretes: How the compoſure of the ſenſative Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan conſiſts, or laſtly how the manner of the various combinations of Sulphureous <hi>Effluvia</hi> (flowing from Fermentative Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of their inteſtine Principles) happen to our Sences, we ſhall not now, I ſay, take time further to diſcuſs, but leave to further enquiry.</p>
